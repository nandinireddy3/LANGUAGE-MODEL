CHAPTER I.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
	1.0719456137544061
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
	1.0703796837074193

	nan
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
	1.1013630140245283
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
	1.073211473525995
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
	1.066260516163524
property of some one or other of their daughters.
	0.0

	nan
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
	1.1011125702318487
Netherfield Park is let at last?"
	1.0272278927620468

	nan
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
	1.0482293403407437

	nan
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
	1.097839473361709
told me all about it."
	1.002385408616337

	nan
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
	1.0366972728586288

	nan
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
	1.0874217540882332

	nan
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
	1.0871137727042788

	nan
This was invitation enough.
	1.0150387440061102

	nan
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
	1.0831953388286517
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
	1.1014543345694998
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
	1.0823293595664247
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
	1.076586116050303
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
	1.0833256836657998
in the house by the end of next week."
	1.0624144782136795

	nan
"What is his name?"
	1.0120159653125875

	nan
"Bingley."
	nan

	nan
"Is he married or single?"
	1.0159478148039565

	nan
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four
	1.0816648418327417
or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
	1.0735610712293833

	nan
"How so? how can it affect them?"
	1.030410984106126

	nan
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
	1.0878821062901571
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
	1.0687825223802445

	nan
"Is that his design in settling here?"
	1.0317709714374539

	nan
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
	1.0823743762902112
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
	1.0575763654446928
soon as he comes."
	0.9958876276023131

	nan
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
	1.113638236806335
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
	1.0626787621439793
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
	1.0946783392657033
party."
	nan

	nan
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
	1.0810827508228842
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has
	1.0966035597053405
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
	1.0734002216488336
beauty."
	nan

	nan
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
	1.0912938562312486

	nan
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
	1.0977027594384068
the neighbourhood."
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
	1.065555021289632

	nan
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
	1.06914748278912
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
	1.0905542645005228
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
	1.0502227465633185
comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
	1.0908326646083821
him, if you do not."
	1.0089219813517074

	nan
"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
	1.0956502851552086
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
	1.0837759284706914
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
	1.0680044737579792
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
	1.0696896280786574

	nan
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
	1.1141311209170632
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
	1.0780888807912983
good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the
	1.0469410518733442
preference."
	nan

	nan
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
	1.0724603407333089
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
	1.0723523807988447
quickness than her sisters."
	0.9952177570954321

	nan
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take
	1.1041741891930954
delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves."
	1.0716075308701685

	nan
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
	1.096031314861933
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
	1.0682042800860854
these twenty years at least."
	0.9959775818792026

	nan
"Ah! you do not know what I suffer."
	1.0421550469472465

	nan
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
	1.1072522210604157
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
	1.0371633316626443

	nan
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
	1.101362929107576
visit them."
	0.9932849106877489

	nan
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
	1.0783581115368361
all."
	nan

	nan
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
	1.0864279457498025
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
	1.0607557447995564
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
	1.0611886016543717
was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,
	1.0762376658863473
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she
	1.0473661561602512
fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
	1.0573370188652687
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

CHAPTER II.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
	1.121050317672837
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
	1.0727947525792405
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
	1.0746702366181584
paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
	1.0831154380804557
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
	1.0577574423396
suddenly addressed her with,
	0.9918160206992798

	nan
"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy."
	1.0558252840131241

	nan
"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother
	1.1053217295007374
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
	1.021370135242019

	nan
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
	1.0729488648624146
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him."
	1.061579178296081

	nan
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
	1.117550988064144
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
	1.0996638895412176
of her."
	1.0040818234041304

	nan
"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
	1.11388784267393
not depend on her serving you."
	1.0305579921170345

	nan
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
	1.0828871682345371
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
	1.0181581290328723

	nan
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
	1.0821589804288911
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."
	1.0423321553396256

	nan
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
	1.0746285752216984
them ill."
	0.9961511122947492

	nan
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.
	1.068115047718697

	nan
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"
	1.043744380432309

	nan
"To-morrow fortnight."
	1.0101708178312803

	nan
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back
	1.0963927170741619
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
	1.0779758179609369
for she will not know him herself."
	1.0332526986966644

	nan
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
	1.0771561647368544
Mr. Bingley to _her_."
	1.0288707712921275

	nan
"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
	1.0729001953772976
myself; how can you be so teazing?"
	1.0180870514506255

	nan
"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
	1.0664735996376957
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
	1.113789859592339
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
	1.0636611291079712
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
	1.0853290296756346
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
	1.0900669014531446
take it on myself."
	1.00059474475245

	nan
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
	1.0799886547260962
nonsense!"
	nan

	nan
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do
	1.0758751366846881
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
	1.076166812717413
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
	1.07222258105643
Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
	1.092973948560513
books, and make extracts."
	1.0008501328368753

	nan
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
	1.0690296589623125

	nan
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.
	1.0863807822569544
Bingley."
	nan

	nan
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.
	1.0625967182028175

	nan
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I
	1.0959758008336018
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
	1.0705414210347532
him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
	1.0839694399776811
cannot escape the acquaintance now."
	1.0018376840374

	nan
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
	1.0830566711069405
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
	1.0795659941991471
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
	1.0836347087738263
while.
	nan

	nan
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
	1.1033082171802464
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
	1.0766839077355366
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
	1.0824701913102168
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
	1.0636772483792942
a word about it till now."
	1.0291256750527702

	nan
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and,
	1.0855542133859781
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
	1.0955133965683927

	nan
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
	1.0745041008040057
shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
	1.0845940286978377
or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so
	1.090166279841066
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
	1.0650935038750118
for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
	1.0905235797654573
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
	1.0941759298806557
ball."
	nan

	nan
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
	1.080158399868753
youngest, I'm the tallest."
	1.0083071314105223

	nan
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
	1.074727030633687
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
	0.0
dinner.

CHAPTER III.

	nan

	nan
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
	1.0858324611290824
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
	1.0541612497313642
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
	1.0686372834295261
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
	1.046146129472534
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
	1.0797143993243463
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
	1.0462535910893485
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
	1.0841927060044207
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
	1.054985760081873
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
	1.0852537518511516
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
	1.0837056208278553
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
	1.0596595638511668
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.
	1.0402398817788157

	nan
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
	1.0760234204951606
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
	1.0794288459008134
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."
	1.043777466499447

	nan
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
	1.1210594089811585
minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
	1.0745161797090335
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
	1.0833307489145567
much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
	1.0644569384976788
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
	1.0557289579957383
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.
	1.0781704164404131

	nan
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
	1.0578018510024094
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
	1.0866686626504138
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
	1.0607950528364058
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
	1.0750989026769655
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite
	1.0753752961773224
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
	0.0
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
	1.0760783184367173
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
	1.066040041493103
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
	1.074987276761589
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
	1.104003131639864
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
	1.0355431342389048
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
	1.089567575861906
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
	1.0801703917193262
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
	1.0647116167216109
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when
	1.086712201462823
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
	1.0704829068986286
altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
	1.077083457643519
another young man.
	0.9972317699672536

	nan
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
	1.0779786520055752
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
	1.0504990591938073
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
	1.0941330515923897
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
	1.073640004235441
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
	1.0801571868594442
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
	1.0574645570179098
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
	1.0655994972631004
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
	1.0909880904008808
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
	1.0541282827941747
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
	1.0454025014151114
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
	1.0730800600739696
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
	0.0
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
	0.0
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
	1.0453103398306824
with his friend.
	1.0099955436356602

	nan
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
	1.0713609613515716
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
	1.0582727092144146
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
	1.077613605643306
himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
	1.037847185869041
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
	1.087088749105547
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
	1.0731841438770526
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
	1.0860432635828516
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
	1.0588792472466713
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
	1.0825084565097056
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.
	1.088069541811667
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
	1.0831138886192326
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
	1.0452012627531628
having slighted one of her daughters.
	1.0062658449910225

	nan
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
	1.0808102569668696
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
	1.0678710212009586
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
	1.0226195787736463
Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
	1.1033205772361394
friend to join it.
	1.0053301066107319

	nan
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you
	1.0927540794380306
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
	1.0275217164797512
dance."
	nan

	nan
"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
	1.0851307368801064
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it
	1.0593278152408039
would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
	1.0640792856314574
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
	1.079028119773191
stand up with."
	0.9963619384273411

	nan
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a
	1.0713040943588987
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
	1.0881892547707201
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
	1.0595522371813768
uncommonly pretty."
	0.993480448142805

	nan
"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.
	1.099554032218457
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
	1.0447029600604796

	nan
"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
	1.0929308302439869
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
	1.0749228583331056
dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."
	1.0581200944936218

	nan
"Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at
	1.0694460121453153
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
	1.0695112953262202
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
	1.0909360869157876
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
	1.0447238913008683
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
	1.0856976540387053
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."
	1.0444842195609556

	nan
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
	1.094721006569221
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story
	1.0572510515132258
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
	1.0507527461534056
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.
	1.0400236167977666

	nan
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
	1.0827683316302932
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
	1.0620517007489771
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
	1.0800691275678533
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her
	1.0649389933987807
mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
	1.0705172324781966
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
	1.074014770208144
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
	1.0600049236941123
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
	1.0532606167535437
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good
	1.0978782823373265
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
	1.0716024613753692
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a
	1.1032545413206247
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
	0.0
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
	1.0735221098684802
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife's
	1.0726931549742014
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
	1.0430102838333692
had a very different story to hear.
	1.040733621634849

	nan
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
	1.1079129976621365
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
	1.0670690697780654
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well
	1.0915251140564766
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
	1.0779830638793066
her twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
	1.0742789812015596
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
	1.0907022906377548
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
	1.111897237035798
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
	1.0677055432550147
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
	1.0674515248059315
down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
	1.0663309071165326
asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss
	1.095091963300287
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
	1.1029416950689888
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"
	1.0567401203745836

	nan
"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
	1.0647510987463615
"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
	1.0969303725043789
his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"
	1.0829077984667614

	nan
"Oh! my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him. He
	1.0920960175667964
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never
	1.0711072858322392
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the
	1.0953988445984824
lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown----"
	1.036184267253129

	nan
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
	1.072551430155101
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
	1.0687398086168678
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
	1.074800415878048
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
	1.055560046195012

	nan
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
	1.0903425633296306
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
	1.0782111425021466
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
	1.075626109616495
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
	1.0486590133046785
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
	1.0671064168755926
dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man."

CHAPTER IV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
	1.086082284098583
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
	1.0840779711638218
she admired him.
	1.0077580710056429

	nan
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
	1.0909864941299574
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
	0.0
with such perfect good breeding!"
	1.0185501561371493

	nan
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
	1.0677827224097929
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."
	1.0702500445522307

	nan
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
	1.1057857162504483
did not expect such a compliment."
	1.0280196075443355

	nan
"Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between
	1.0897654144649107
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
	1.026170156904871
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
	1.0649006895149933
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
	1.0684792357261053
the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
	1.1041259831419377
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
	1.1027220294117508
stupider person."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Dear Lizzy!"
	nan

	nan
"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.
	1.0979645395216668
You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable
	1.106506361337121
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."
	1.1125000545876478

	nan
"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
	1.096371235901168
what I think."
	1.0031947895818372

	nan
"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
	1.094703555668742
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
	1.0753533366986723
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
	1.0403453083284895
where. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
	1.0775239605984326
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
	1.0831348136067547
the bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man's sisters too,
	1.1026852474244924
do you? Their manners are not equal to his."
	1.0362172902391429

	nan
"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
	1.077171007128873
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
	1.0531091688277425
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
	1.0838166128528448
neighbour in her."
	0.9942758754025454

	nan
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
	1.0596691936988132
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
	1.0851763439321853
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
	1.0543853891825312
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
	1.086341610985729
little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not
	1.0855403803547272
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
	0.0
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were
	1.055416319788635
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
	0.9984695583354131
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
	1.0766118397978393
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
	1.0447186648380562
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
	1.0823445368119837
themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in
	1.0774147081147305
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
	1.0673083625470958
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
	1.0452500360226835
acquired by trade.
	0.9964412684889373

	nan
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
	1.0805265086980578
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
	1.060381103437895
but did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
	1.0906037177228607
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
	1.0741400912746746
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
	1.0867566663824637
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
	1.0683469467995912
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
	1.0760181448021096
purchase.
	nan

	nan
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
	1.084668467682997
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
	1.0639322269891656
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
	1.061903516428427
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
	1.068817611047073
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
	1.1045066935101786
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
	1.0552910254139682
look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an
	1.076619536554922
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
	1.0578900924444037
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
	1.0811947798253132

	nan
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
	1.0885170814724696
great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
	1.0476334507695677
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
	1.0415938044104935
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
	1.0836051439278207
appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the
	1.078105366178717
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In
	1.0638624246759718
understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,
	1.0736175450091883
but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
	1.0893068782288413
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In
	1.0573608909716021
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of
	1.0835373349409692
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
	1.0710193882223336
characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
	1.0551234564583298
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
	1.057236214885861
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
	1.060392086096334
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
	1.1000030847468771
more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
	1.0778941789651046
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
	1.090506623212396
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
	0.0
pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
	1.069398510551958
much.
	nan

	nan
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
	1.0967247940597316
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
	1.097954058082981
they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
	1.0673427520593222
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
	1.0596583849809897
commendation to think of her as he chose.

CHAPTER V.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
	1.0823479083801464
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
	1.0621304923964567
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
	1.077459516296676
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.
	1.0604612015310928
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
	1.081253016983264
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
	1.0765449043653867
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
	1.0756948990291801
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
	1.0560355055122466
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
	1.0570390694610345
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For
	1.0348907948639665
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
	1.055694602640354
contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,
	1.0582082320360768
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him
	1.0609101621668242
courteous.
	nan

	nan
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
	1.099176788581694
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The
	1.0218980078921371
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
	1.051571077010364
was Elizabeth's intimate friend.
	1.023779935137172

	nan
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
	1.104003398116832
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
	1.0486466868050126
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
	1.0507322221497288

	nan
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil
	1.0782530001784243
self-command to Miss Lucas. "_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice."
	1.0682018933930773

	nan
"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."
	1.0547831590681465

	nan
"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. To be
	1.09067665595667
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
	1.07132157531273
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
	1.0662984948890621
about Mr. Robinson."
	1.0115482370606954

	nan
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
	1.0837018614568559
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
	1.1026575882855796
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
	1.0550519512721044
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
	1.0464443211050982
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
	1.063837993544127
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."
	0.0

	nan
"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
	1.077584699644445
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."
	1.0619674289582466

	nan
"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
	1.0692701856176683
Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
	1.1034105936742042
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."
	1.0513713085798306

	nan
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
	1.0954714423488785
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
	1.06810894354354
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
	1.116550008430876
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."
	1.069922743859617

	nan
"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said
	1.073101602864498
Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."
	1.0764074395852594

	nan
"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
	1.0751817436737252
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
	1.0689155201428016
being spoke to."
	1.001278493955659

	nan
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless
	1.0679524403850538
among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably
	1.040927629010437
agreeable."
	nan

	nan
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
	1.1050212735693072
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was;
	1.0979017571466676
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
	1.0933562895135231
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
	1.0847009163134367
the ball in a hack chaise."
	1.0386575112224719

	nan
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
	1.1102595979916057
wish he had danced with Eliza."
	1.0190651670675097

	nan
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
	1.0706118925612085
if I were you."
	1.0153752523467683

	nan
"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."
	1.0881884469378347

	nan
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
	1.0779360528357078
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
	1.0846080543222318
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
	1.0799229110806112
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
	1.091828731729018
to be proud."
	1.0111952039199295

	nan
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
	1.0687721060917637
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."
	1.0389443286253768

	nan
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
	1.0657037023023983
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have
	1.0714035352566915
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
	1.052758217320518
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
	1.073341272013428
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
	1.07674767128733
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
	1.0568881648751782
things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be
	1.0175228334206803
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
	0.0
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."
	1.0068541851072281

	nan
"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
	1.1157119036220393
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
	1.0968905112824596
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."
	1.0597230520768013

	nan
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.
	1.0786757551979924
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle
	1.1007910778491574
directly."
	nan

	nan
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
	1.081875472146525
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.

CHAPTER VI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
	1.082394726863207
was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
	1.0848815866150159
good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
	1.0821615356547967
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
	1.063945668545029
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
	1.0511987131039893
two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
	1.0733219527807725
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
	1.0442284258277243
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
	1.058731509443074
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
	1.066224938688
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was
	1.0724887414473105
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
	1.027486644540579
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
	1.0633794382817836
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
	1.0921845157814563
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
	1.0775298427052542
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
	1.07649378284653
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
	1.053359764647593
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
	0.0
suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss
	1.059632855604003
Lucas.
	nan

	nan
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
	1.0673433207011775
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
	1.103280135939725
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
	1.0954300796436982
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
	1.0926984740568735
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
	1.0706037601942022
dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
	1.0657199954759229
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
	1.082245496728847
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
	1.0218296267611198
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
	1.0839693798786936
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
	1.077585553381045
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
	0.0
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
	1.0458405515594833

	nan
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can
	1.1056944636782788
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
	1.0630163664498309
discover it too."
	0.9979593807687105

	nan
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."
	1.0814439357453436

	nan
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
	1.0994078651502717
it, he must find it out."
	1.0205970444455992

	nan
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane
	1.0908594044157385
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
	1.0723467735311494
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
	0.0
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
	1.0610871389387033
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
	1.0691225123697463
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
	0.0
in love as much as she chuses."
	1.0309997833158941

	nan
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
	1.07251763690273
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
	1.06699541065747
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
	1.1131667162485763
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she
	1.0893960564547158
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
	1.0586564975429624
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
	1.0853381428576787
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
	1.0585251374126075
and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
	1.0972671153944336
enough to make her understand his character."
	1.0301679573786202

	nan
"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
	1.0820825901043476
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
	1.0529899350485559
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
	1.0588581949285811
evenings may do a great deal."
	0.998164618241368

	nan
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
	1.0659240551458393
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
	1.0625775072940273
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."
	1.0445730414196548

	nan
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
	1.0831158966395216
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
	1.096018170003299
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
	1.0776606737587415
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
	1.0760533776371206
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
	1.0981553223784941
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
	1.0533665415615416
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
	1.054791641058123
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
	1.0747553251064819
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
	1.0840370464995364
life."
	nan

	nan
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
	1.100534596124919
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
	1.052938992049334

	nan
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
	1.076442166158184
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
	1.0734482501741047
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
	1.0871895051881388
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
	1.0720808217420266
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
	1.0911469719765228
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
	1.0719349342112054
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
	1.0731224547647693
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
	1.0453196641922007
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
	1.0515443764233294
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
	1.0466639567667324
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
	1.0817459744896816
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
	1.0693470114211958
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
	1.0799348530536617
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
	1.0869938275630662
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
	1.0422186490855512
to dance with.
	1.011723604209528

	nan
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
	1.0965732301447992
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
	1.07905484516443
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
	1.1015915584828238
assembled.
	nan

	nan
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
	1.0932040850556253
conversation with Colonel Forster?"
	0.9972360454809671

	nan
"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."
	1.0739223453949278

	nan
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
	1.0953827761014878
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
	1.1095668315793574
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."
	1.0535971201093883

	nan
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
	1.0593967859016011
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
	1.0697698491989576
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
	1.0712368434222304
turned to him and said,
	1.0114092264097705

	nan
"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
	1.0793258806122774
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
	1.0804433964171796
Meryton?"
	nan

	nan
"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
	1.0750202509236118
energetic."
	nan

	nan
"You are severe on us."
	1.0224176683227808

	nan
"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas. "I am going
	1.1003095145400992
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."
	1.0638782879037498

	nan
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
	1.0905762740177942
to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken
	1.0938795212122234
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
	1.081991443376949
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
	1.0742131349015955
hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
	1.0677307042292914
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
	1.09250459041931
at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
	1.105126176393514
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
	1.0641920564422604
shall keep mine to swell my song."
	1.0324713313207243

	nan
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
	1.081125851352747
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
	1.0884711874121578
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
	1.0648383719571888
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
	1.0718579549275677
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
	1.0592720705199439
impatient for display.
	1.0029175858374617

	nan
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
	1.063892446139348
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
	1.0430357934777192
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
	1.049358311746342
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
	1.0682418683194508
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
	1.0564352536204584
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
	1.062344559153864
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
	1.0824015765947712
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
	1.0758265218711616
at one end of the room.
	1.0276952278302645

	nan
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
	1.091159825895153
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
	1.0623830760962572
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
	1.046417633747691
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.
	1.0453800948481864

	nan
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There
	1.0867488433874495
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
	1.0831830616153972
refinements of polished societies."
	1.018283908597443

	nan
"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
	1.0811117318410441
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can
	1.0681885324135405
dance."
	nan

	nan
Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully;" he
	1.0579736269513724
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
	1.0744653719835942
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."
	1.0879052242246396

	nan
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."
	1.0541098273456915

	nan
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
	1.0803786556289443
you often dance at St. James's?"
	1.031222178059265

	nan
"Never, sir."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"
	1.0744869523901122

	nan
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
	1.1168760747624855

	nan
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"
	1.039638443350516

	nan
Mr. Darcy bowed.
	1.020622289384306

	nan
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
	1.094394612445442
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
	1.063764756732983
London would agree with Lady Lucas."
	1.034012045545146

	nan
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
	1.0826488375000096
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
	1.056869442138835
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
	0.0
her,
	nan

	nan
"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr. Darcy, you must allow
	1.0883330273835095
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
	1.0770040182142542
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."
	1.0666325909508405
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
	1.0906327181392395
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
	1.0138394971195541
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,
	1.0512203020682456

	nan
"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
	1.094923550519791
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."
	1.1068005897149056

	nan
Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
	1.0944712342701224
hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
	1.0787587053737697
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
	1.0402558313357504

	nan
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
	1.1097056480180305
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
	1.0650071436587127
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
	1.0747689533546556
for one half hour."
	1.0128133147246046

	nan
"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.
	1.0616292729572476

	nan
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
	1.0767674727432721
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
	1.0455333195771948
partner?"
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
	1.061167231190707
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
	1.057653779120037
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,
	0.9922717519657139

	nan
"I can guess the subject of your reverie."
	1.0511788920363672

	nan
"I should imagine not."
	1.0189407029815272

	nan
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
	1.0643083644812008
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
	1.0884450190688253
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the
	1.0783791437478196
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
	1.0796740760808967
I give to hear your strictures on them!"
	1.043460563086407

	nan
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
	1.0799938010891907
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
	1.0686744051171861
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."
	1.1010801785010478

	nan
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
	1.0726187704318597
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
	1.0766070660982205
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,
	1.036670918950177

	nan
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
	1.0123111639599869

	nan
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment.
	1.0760469034765057
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you
	1.1054400638210866
joy?"
	nan

	nan
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
	1.0998385220221805
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
	1.061748571657364
to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."
	1.0964861295275385

	nan
"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
	1.0810591703583043
absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
	1.0599020856350114
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."
	1.060185424825238

	nan
He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
	1.0626628516089363
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
	1.0556227723255995
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.

CHAPTER VII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
	1.0839454429973097
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
	1.0516238690452884
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
	1.0733134266196056
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
	1.0577176427905208
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
	1.0905107291575034
had left her four thousand pounds.
	1.0253716273735018

	nan
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
	1.1225134082547252
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
	1.070023571234336
London in a respectable line of trade.
	1.0441317490276545

	nan
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
	1.0720147732769383
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
	1.024815878412208
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
	1.0752922458120715
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
	1.1143609800550383
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
	1.0499272745762511
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
	1.0419719459722756
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
	1.0616077071694918
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
	1.0583162690487093
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
	1.0634960506426363
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
	1.0670937692996854
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
	1.076537748832141
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
	1.0506061656550407
head quarters.
	0.9978740815565763

	nan
Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
	1.0871093422812996
intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
	1.0509741492948725
officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
	0.0
and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips
	1.092188286535416
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
	1.0696535836266057
unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
	1.0586839036646452
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
	1.0761260476201249
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
	1.0624154499852332
an ensign.
	1.0001317291084484

	nan
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
	1.0704704669156966
Bennet coolly observed,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
	1.0948172919043002
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
	1.1064561003040845
I am now convinced."
	1.0160007803537836

	nan
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
	1.0647586934987139
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
	1.0434212480782932
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
	1.0987788253852693
next morning to London.
	1.007125243058382

	nan
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so
	1.0787251727593923
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
	0.0
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."
	1.083181525227871

	nan
"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."
	1.0936257988800286

	nan
"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."
	1.071837268440758

	nan
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
	1.1030802887119238
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
	1.0671089508597429
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
	1.074213273948983
foolish."
	nan

	nan
"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
	1.1048146734354853
their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will
	1.0912990209187032
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
	1.1018598685888892
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
	1.0810713149630058
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
	1.0880103167558672
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
	1.082317953255025
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
	1.0889541767190356
regimentals."
	nan

	nan
"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
	1.0629382878916585
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
	1.1025313538471047
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."
	0.0

	nan
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
	1.100773759099787
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
	1.0562424929775867
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
	1.094398752320013
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
	1.0195022408741554

	nan
"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,
	1.093145171268965
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."
	1.0598547126938755

	nan
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.
	1.0822048961913673

	nan
     "My dear Friend,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
     "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
	1.0828632367359934
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
	1.0755013730333112
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
	1.0727951963903868
     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
	1.0696113706463382
     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
	1.0936360869058654
     Yours ever,
	nan

	nan
     "CAROLINE BINGLEY."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
	1.099804404830575
_that_."
	nan

	nan
"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."
	1.0672324255003192

	nan
"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.
	1.0458997824251546

	nan
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
	1.0755022660097218
rain; and then you must stay all night."
	1.025878132283828

	nan
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
	1.0786331970928906
they would not offer to send her home."
	1.0327252447040236

	nan
"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
	1.1037608316823335
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."
	1.0549107005293805

	nan
"I had much rather go in the coach."
	1.046795403886269

	nan
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
	1.0963717240876065
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?"
	1.0304822822680584

	nan
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."
	1.086895896879217

	nan
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
	1.0849078168164739
will be answered."
	0.995956996622118

	nan
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
	1.0773224717389023
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
	1.0763442529092542
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
	1.0744190701306047
day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
	1.0749836140305082
rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
	1.0784825694132494
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
	1.051349189606407
Jane certainly could not come back.
	1.0299911698846098

	nan
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet, more than
	1.094831180182083
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
	1.094943321389659
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
	1.052398540113987
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
	1.0540497882943876
brought the following note for Elizabeth:
	1.0052708594569235

	nan
     "My dearest Lizzy,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
     "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
	1.0820241329145084
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
	1.0646310360022744
     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
	1.0895962819434992
     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
	1.0824747932417833
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
	1.0889892630643645
     there is not much the matter with me.
	1.0476227937220772

	nan
     "Yours, &c."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
	1.0784719457593817
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
	1.0794950941837835
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
	1.0899220543716184
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."
	1.0425981891610192

	nan
"Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little
	1.1108496193353197
trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays
	1.1013831421904359
there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the
	1.1140337453739046
carriage."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
	1.0649403074488426
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
	1.0971103432984175
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
	1.0520844598612915

	nan
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
	1.08831245278162
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
	1.0813166476900078
there."
	nan

	nan
"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."
	1.0868705421825704

	nan
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
	1.088513692212756
horses?"
	nan

	nan
"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
	1.1126665371274191
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."
	1.089622728714566

	nan
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
	1.0681928600978108
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
	1.0441851534244198
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
	1.0276427511190909

	nan
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
	1.063052625792376
Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
	1.077693360036875
off together.
	0.9915102121788149

	nan
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
	1.07334018210209
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."
	1.0362558021254196

	nan
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
	1.088587074849533
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
	1.0677387713918514
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
	1.0504174200156025
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
	1.0235533101533905
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
	1.0646315057473645
glowing with the warmth of exercise.
	1.0388290146489694

	nan
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
	1.0740745118582775
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
	1.0254716325532691
surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
	1.05961525863026
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.
	1.0761994668476176
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
	1.0735196882396163
in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;
	1.076286110534831
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
	1.0640397584835775
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very
	1.0683953105478938
little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between
	1.089514335482239
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
	1.0365990939263594
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The
	1.1006012248307364
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.
	1.0223758537557968

	nan
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
	1.0675986128237478
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
	1.080355560041842
enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
	1.0804023936677218
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
	1.0696426274916178
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
	1.0544137470956496
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
	1.0862355712647604
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
	1.049542752069783
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
	1.0397265303813916
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
	0.0
her.
	nan

	nan
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
	1.0683368926745878
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
	1.0339545583807963
solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
	1.0518815992520805
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
	1.0618537185059416
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
	1.0619682628050822
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
	1.0732382728350074
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
	1.0632965408081654
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
	1.0885240785307717
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
	1.0865255968167917
nothing to do elsewhere.
	1.005274090136143

	nan
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
	1.0841134514872697
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
	1.0623418801494195
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
	1.0410712253028183
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
	1.0769607113742576
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
	1.0720683993198845
present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
	0.0
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
	1.0739623965922498
back a supply of clothes.

CHAPTER VIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
	1.1000343450205579
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then
	1.0764909427583769
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
	1.0744090390540169
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
	1.0720964624107256
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
	1.073302719434952
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
	1.0573272151685573
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
	1.060217174950438
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
	1.0686107068586272
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
	1.0260439628668663
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.
	1.0610477286078461

	nan
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
	1.0870800208472253
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
	1.068453350490285
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
	1.0508823916004946
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
	1.0678763728671157
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
	1.078473626671418
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
	1.073137275480924
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
	1.085446137072249
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
	1.061639158938561
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
	1.0623145779197105

	nan
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
	1.0690568564932617
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
	1.0609769110582965
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
	1.0689404051942515
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst
	1.0900728722627875
thought the same, and added,
	1.0040365282486807

	nan
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
	1.0730937791675832
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
	1.0665899354616544
looked almost wild."
	1.000528330278131

	nan
"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
	1.0812711442704368
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
	1.0697125272749677
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"
	1.02588217270014

	nan
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
	1.0778066676838183
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
	1.095466807533444
hide it, not doing its office."
	1.0132635263432106

	nan
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
	1.0704707480267466
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
	1.0655172575938896
well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat
	1.0817325292237074
quite escaped my notice."
	1.0027201042308302

	nan
"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
	1.0967381531743365
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
	1.0716048112672105
an exhibition."
	1.0001317291084484

	nan
"Certainly not."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
	1.0761957985168378
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
	1.0693888251869568
it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
	1.0734304498672596
a most country town indifference to decorum."
	1.0338224382348835

	nan
"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
	1.069963056244837
Bingley.
	nan

	nan
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
	1.0830171705238412
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
	1.061524762798476
eyes."
	nan

	nan
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A
	1.0788005241062295
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.
	1.0535378648319562

	nan
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
	1.0849936866794727
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such
	1.0970576655065434
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
	1.0851154912815926
chance of it."
	1.001443926868504

	nan
"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
	1.0811007020421057
Meryton."
	nan

	nan
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."
	1.0569279351215985

	nan
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
	1.0705858134745967

	nan
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
	1.068157589941705
would not make them one jot less agreeable."
	1.041290103765955

	nan
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
	1.0743323607656174
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.
	1.0211746294718171

	nan
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
	1.0795235610808158
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
	1.0728168786901595
their dear friend's vulgar relations.
	1.0175522524288587

	nan
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
	1.070462053263574
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
	1.0816334246669912
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
	1.08678464541899
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
	1.077611382124731
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
	1.0656167034292936
down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
	1.0576168951745997
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
	1.0587521293973556
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
	1.067239495671693
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
	1.0496128402143998
below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
	1.0840226868697194

	nan
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."
	1.0734833398104278

	nan
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great
	1.0887577441358374
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."
	1.043226094257041

	nan
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
	1.0683549391442526
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."
	1.0650095225759655

	nan
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
	1.075648404169273
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."
	1.0688700130294948

	nan
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
	1.066319880233757
where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
	1.0678201231175546
others; all that his library afforded.
	1.0092187346796753

	nan
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
	1.078947610364363
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
	1.0765619920897138
than I ever look into."
	1.01160592071243

	nan
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
	1.057615160625819
in the room.
	1.0110579163967996

	nan
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
	1.06508595447743
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
	1.0876134814876557
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"
	1.0123111639599869

	nan
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
	1.0917860249209803
generations."
	nan

	nan
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
	1.0727251849685868
books."
	nan

	nan
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
	1.0839490009170583
these."
	nan

	nan
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
	1.0838722296600116
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
	1.0932372205494327
half as delightful as Pemberley."
	1.017629407104594

	nan
"I wish it may."
	1.0168465106653028

	nan
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
	1.0715336589176578
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
	1.0687764791832084
finer county in England than Derbyshire."
	1.0185710338729226

	nan
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."
	1.099572075020062

	nan
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
	1.0308316427812905

	nan
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
	1.0705257083994923
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."
	1.0339344229244414

	nan
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
	1.0850654945073148
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
	0.0
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
	1.0779344624453335
sister, to observe the game.
	1.0196902149179814

	nan
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
	1.079450910293128
she be as tall as I am?"
	1.026706473635785

	nan
"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
	1.103566346686375
rather taller."
	0.9821226380017768

	nan
"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
	1.0959775048532747
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely
	1.0675741313896414
accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is
	1.0571864584183914
exquisite."
	nan

	nan
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
	1.0816291307620765
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."
	1.0569428462998287

	nan
"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"
	1.0673366741829764

	nan
"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
	1.1015145846162409
purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
	1.110463198974846
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
	1.0347547384307547
informed that she was very accomplished."
	1.0236608465318682

	nan
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
	1.0679251855363288
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
	1.086347384710905
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very
	1.1000462250463863
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
	1.0397415664586473
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
	1.0596736216635485
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."
	1.0162172490953736

	nan
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.
	1.04946964244031

	nan
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
	1.061416952805661
idea of an accomplished woman."
	1.00026927801059

	nan
"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."
	1.0564095866699377

	nan
"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
	1.0622639050544707
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
	1.0431504635235604
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
	1.084588984219018
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
	1.0733913480026325
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
	1.0765622929854362
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
	1.0620566213461822
will be but half deserved."
	1.0074284128001638

	nan
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
	1.0928059927278582
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
	1.0511477976211214
extensive reading."
	0.9807750263947368

	nan
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
	1.0781415602627504
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."
	1.046458051409354

"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
	1.0967012308646371
this?"
	nan

	nan
"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
	1.1008568547728654
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."
	1.0191178044448794

	nan
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
	1.09690008005275
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
	1.0585118261763957
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
	1.0606823006304718
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
	1.0583935062034893
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
	1.043464584848315
room.
	nan

	nan
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
	1.087746304668492
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
	1.074582565015345
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
	1.0576000359799858
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."
	1.1102212447343767

	nan
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
	1.0587443667362855
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
	1.0611898190193576
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
	1.0686637966967718
despicable."
	nan

	nan
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
	1.0726969304581848
continue the subject.
	0.0

	nan
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
	1.0731554393989022
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for
	1.1088875470587316
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
	1.0341004037796018
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
	1.0811348654336426
eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
	1.0895233206927475
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
	1.0602084136589263
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
	1.1049953273601447
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
	1.0568435458143939
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
	1.0485932250736743
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
	1.059125587759936
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
	1.0471267325683393
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

CHAPTER IX.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
	1.1074944826291888
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
	1.0800124538642166
enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
	1.064664861496344
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
	1.0843333434301012
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
	1.0761454508805848
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
	1.0517637500350678
own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
	1.0649757989574355
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
	1.0682798460858434
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
	1.0594018599025776

	nan
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
	1.0934017859953598
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
	1.06875731603699
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
	1.0632569078833534
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
	1.0473619456015846
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
	1.0693868143986696
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
	1.0658984892655343
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
	1.0824234191399602
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
	1.0676067579136548
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
	1.058903902416759
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
	1.090553005893333

	nan
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be
	1.1138195267298034
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
	1.1131947400213948
a little longer on your kindness."
	1.0326142051112277

	nan
"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
	1.0988587770167557
sure, will not hear of her removal."
	1.0254155602918413

	nan
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
	1.070921163693737
"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
	1.0569195602290948
remains with us."
	0.9992133840026521

	nan
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
	1.0507437090556908

	nan
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
	1.099187178255802
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
	1.0856004209039578
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
	1.0100025715995136
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
	0.0
temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
	0.0
_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
	1.1032666195886682
over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is
	1.0643888225301508
equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
	1.087676030892426
hope, though you have but a short lease."
	1.005545630109327

	nan
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
	1.0940824555138187
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
	1.062354050923277
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
	1.0683071898901397

	nan
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.
	1.0764990379327701

	nan
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.
	1.066788389765871

	nan
"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly."
	1.0294829274392685

	nan
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
	1.0956795503282866
through I am afraid is pitiful."
	0.0

	nan
"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
	1.0882672985751
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."
	1.069629686207375

	nan
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
	1.0797173928525257
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."
	1.0688170932743222

	nan
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
	1.0655532010757858
studier of character. It must be an amusing study."
	1.0633634812134738

	nan
"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
	1.0758526678659623
least that advantage."
	1.001384984489924

	nan
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
	1.0659197041065587
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
	1.085588224174768
and unvarying society."
	1.0119921094169368

	nan
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
	1.0813558196143964
observed in them for ever."
	0.0

	nan
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
	1.083678755065155
country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
	1.0151369570701347
going on in the country as in town."
	1.0260831430710475

	nan
Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
	1.0750823989829086
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
	1.0718998576172687
victory over him, continued her triumph.
	1.0285832753361432

	nan
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
	1.081082140679924
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
	1.100290259892526
pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?"
	1.0161022672406181

	nan
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and
	1.1012224372724957
when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
	1.0981955994841515
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
	0.0

	nan
"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
	1.0748001768222994
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
	1.041975893929575
at all."
	1.0002275686981978

	nan
"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
	1.0542977704112546
mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not
	1.1031668053450998
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
	1.110760729312881
you must acknowledge to be true."
	1.0219403388183923

	nan
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
	1.0708169062557975
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
	1.0469430550783774
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families."
	1.0800266002568069

	nan
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
	1.0629595594979353
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
	1.0597267956811496
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
	1.0972810285836139
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
	1.0730676581028518
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.
	1.067188155090171

	nan
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
	1.0807707174231662
William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
	1.1033586785035063
genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every
	1.0592313146204642
body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
	1.0763927324944849
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
	1.0552872044003332
matter."
	nan

	nan
"Did Charlotte dine with you?"
	1.0183173612171303

	nan
"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For
	1.1213733199520848
my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
	1.0860139562245847
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to
	1.0550961561127332
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
	1.0754947100326724
assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
	1.0868225975748842
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."
	1.0699129482404055

	nan
"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.
	1.0597486916866605

	nan
"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
	1.0914663621499465
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast
	1.1003422746893987
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body
	1.0991279239975817
better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own
	1.0938128770613156
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
	0.0
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
	1.0673143223487154
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
	1.0821580393626644
But however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he
	1.0916842072361637
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."
	1.0204334731233369

	nan
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has
	1.0661568297542743
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
	1.1073904199051101
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
	1.043454477275733

	nan
"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.
	1.094996068219774

	nan
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is
	1.0869054941680067
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
	1.0759360834965257
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
	1.058029867458331

	nan
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
	1.063707557163705
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
	1.0750982040133896
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
	1.0731036853850473
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
	1.0745428478980648
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
	1.103805800890301
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
	0.0
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
	0.0
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
	1.050696551420735
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
	1.049414598240445
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
	1.0724654756087033
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
	1.082651938401284
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
	1.0503227529604144
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
	1.0308350864913023

	nan
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
	1.0828909003178149
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
	1.0542220282644272
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
	0.0
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
	1.0671145575305114
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
	1.0920689858118264
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
	1.0436546287338968
equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
	1.0821149443343525
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
	1.0556155213211722
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
	1.0773235401702521
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.
	1.0333754648376547

	nan
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
	1.0711593293772947
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
	1.078750920507915
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."
	1.1058101836856191

	nan
Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes--it would be much better to
	1.0755905650824034
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
	1.0330497179666347
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball," she
	1.0770165306181343
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
	0.0
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."
	1.067524382785665

	nan
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
	1.0641519922816958
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
	1.0631606270680058
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
	1.0913073654937593
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
	1.0834628338166388
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.

CHAPTER X.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
	1.1072418360315677
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
	1.0784714418883357
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
	1.0484694487226232
their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.
	1.090077738118221
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
	1.0810096400886746
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
	1.0704757868684889
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
	1.1139155832255778
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
	1.0392782602379782

	nan
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
	1.058726198543249
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
	0.0
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
	1.0829282622282168
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
	1.0948605206094655
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
	1.0676974106293882
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.
	1.0382662908823173

	nan
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"
	1.065314745540731

	nan
He made no answer.
	1.01871806922568

	nan
"You write uncommonly fast."
	1.0165579499884625

	nan
"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."
	1.0431443610438502

	nan
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
	1.090176689727554
year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"
	1.0587714944848547

	nan
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."
	1.0903052830653521

	nan
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."
	1.06059754742543

	nan
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."
	1.0585794823771935

	nan
"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
	1.1178854729846213
pens remarkably well."
	1.011757696523356

	nan
"Thank you--but I always mend my own."
	1.0411022709360074

	nan
"How can you contrive to write so even?"
	1.0346114945544345

	nan
He was silent.
	1.0106238906437561

	nan
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
	1.088223586345407
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
	1.079163785898354
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
	1.0674655666886756
Grantley's."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At
	1.0867839643277064
present I have not room to do them justice."
	0.0

	nan
"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
	1.1188058669780896
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"
	0.0

	nan
"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
	1.0678247843816393
to determine."
	1.0054348241103839

	nan
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
	1.1050476888136498
ease, cannot write ill."
	0.0

	nan
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
	1.0738250047792874
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
	1.0651821559513823
words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"
	1.0361332360842657

	nan
"My style of writing is very different from yours."
	1.0576182735652924

	nan
"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
	1.069585864475948
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."
	1.0782851642832314

	nan
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
	1.0897247358786377
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."
	1.0596994191225573

	nan
"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."
	1.0673745489900694

	nan
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
	1.0586536091940726
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
	1.064430045148765
indirect boast."
	0.9999368869799892

	nan
"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
	1.087985219107135

	nan
"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
	1.0631611915080144
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
	1.025759189233471
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
	1.0381499142899138
at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with
	1.0677040577861503
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
	1.0541469970125645
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
	0.0
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
	1.0582848536535787
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
	1.0774282742837071
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
	1.0587239507001438
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
	1.0542705304511049
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"
	1.0872792158029116

	nan
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
	1.0838637272313243
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
	1.0850077417290693
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
	1.0627953588275003
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
	1.0779740622160716
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."
	1.0338023876507592

	nan
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
	1.085041331784184
would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
	1.075907744133304
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
	1.087899949568786
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
	1.0784970760580348
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
	1.0483496655319795
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."
	1.0396218120315162

	nan
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did
	1.0775052865282662
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much
	1.092425799704165
more than he did himself."
	1.0120310032821211

	nan
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
	1.0646294859457865
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
	1.0689116123136961
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
	1.0652641607015427
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
	1.0405471616012196
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
	1.0850357630850085
could."
	nan

	nan
"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
	1.077781962564245
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"
	1.0544781640599403

	nan
"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
	1.0825692272155776
himself."
	nan

	nan
"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
	1.0758399796752514
which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand
	1.0666301951047226
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
	1.0411878120347229
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
	1.0989596020817514
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
	1.0597333877470003
argument in favour of its propriety."
	1.0113176678921247

	nan
"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
	1.0847916418792054
with you."
	1.003844757300336

	nan
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
	1.068669319976467
either."
	nan

	nan
"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
	1.0944163416086397
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
	0.0
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
	1.0626622562771741
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
	1.083223047616895
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
	1.0855021268574399
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
	1.0446645240371755
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
	1.0549154706069612
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
	1.0811913035221472
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
	1.063465632925229
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
	1.0603701285823794

	nan
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
	1.0740212465447525
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
	1.060812762516993
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
	1.075876904929784
between the parties?"
	0.9981462830309862

	nan
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
	1.0700368203660724
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
	1.052077906084031
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
	1.0820506836075925
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
	1.0787208136945292
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
	1.1029602729146049
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
	1.0669837898087278
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
	1.0330062353183616
when he has nothing to do."
	1.0215576368767765

	nan
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
	1.0815412523922239
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
	1.0263099248841099
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
	1.055851126621285
brother for talking such nonsense.
	1.0112266693458536

	nan
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an
	1.0726609450742504
argument, and want to silence this."
	1.01772283426613

	nan
"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
	1.097851319481278
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
	1.0992954777884767
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."
	1.0438989270651917

	nan
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
	1.0839085751491004
Darcy had much better finish his letter."
	1.0360766332394618

	nan
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
	1.0694819859171638

	nan
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
	1.0720626021057933
for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
	1.0890517802001167
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
	1.0749649741526308
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
	1.076038255742008
seated herself.
	0.9948952232295698

	nan
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
	1.0795841711807435
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
	1.062692185528037
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
	1.090805088413353
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
	1.1000797995975513
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
	1.06958063437887
he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however
	1.0712962663384689
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
	1.0723219323016433
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
	1.0671351201233885
in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
	1.089514429949645
him too little to care for his approbation.
	1.0293148927028857

	nan
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
	1.080404491716253
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
	1.053435125723935
Elizabeth, said to her--
	1.010740412560208

	nan
"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
	1.0782838580926772
opportunity of dancing a reel?"
	1.0111126170737994

	nan
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
	1.0865607539815814
surprise at her silence.
	0.9910241076355155

	nan
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
	1.0648297421885005
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
	1.0844060417169075
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
	1.0749017013707252
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
	1.057054771196404
their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell
	1.0761371069597574
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
	1.1070649008821947
you dare."
	0.9965373586108592

	nan
"Indeed I do not dare."
	1.0245271317176032

	nan
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
	1.0575966328205402
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
	1.0590199897056984
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
	1.0522211370921455
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
	1.0525679574873563
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
	1.0457952093495264
should be in some danger.
	1.01661575196513

	nan
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
	1.071566301251751
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
	1.0550994929435813
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
	1.0246133377355664

	nan
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
	1.0855266702227153
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
	1.060281585409899

	nan
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
	1.0755185914190488
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
	1.0692373942325577
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
	1.0561226416850638
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
	1.0882251237256433
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
	1.0934945673126546
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
	0.0
which your lady possesses."
	1.0133853071358647

	nan
"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"
	1.061736211711129

	nan
"Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
	1.0912096561551783
placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle
	1.0911380275957008
the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
	1.0934296108141959
lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
	1.089407711824268
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
	1.0379886865891257

	nan
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
	1.0732188021618434
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
	1.0642638210322561
copied."
	nan

	nan
At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and
	1.087143099503481
Elizabeth herself.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
	1.0830683688885012
confusion, lest they had been overheard.
	1.0087316616068787

	nan
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running away
	1.0664966274947214
without telling us that you were coming out."
	1.0247138930631732

	nan
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
	1.0949089922785813
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness
	1.0958936081198134
and immediately said,--
	1.0044284609350762

	nan
"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
	1.0982517329193737
avenue."
	nan

	nan
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
	1.0763502352418604
laughingly answered,
	nan

	nan
"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
	1.0916136877722415
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
	1.0613710565769576
fourth. Good bye."
	1.0164481554674092

	nan
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
	1.084942336451783
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
	1.09310595656131
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.

CHAPTER XI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
	1.0763625297098605
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
	1.0619843203398895
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
	1.0567408807921668
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
	1.047211521155969
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
	1.072074466286478
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
	1.061566605816406
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
	1.0493073282054768
at their acquaintance with spirit.
	1.0193928963407413

	nan
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.
	1.0907021210193124
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
	1.070511842969477
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
	1.0774181344132054
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
	1.0478275370985162
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
	1.0787588676740707
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and
	1.0887791812292973
attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
	0.0
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
	1.0811706863866721
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
	1.0898273295484515
door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.
	1.0901340477750978
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
	1.0738809254197617
delight.
	nan

	nan
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
	1.082823045919136
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
	1.040942505758988
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
	1.0943138591917647
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
	1.0862726647278418
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr.
	1.1041268400093305
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
	1.0873737998484752
sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
	1.1094953010543962
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
	1.0732211262686067
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
	1.0727656217404513
Bennet.
	nan

	nan
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
	1.0800696522410969
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
	1.0831568691469
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
	1.0519007375621328
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
	1.0632450539933525
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
	1.0785742830005698
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
	1.0749429870296143
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
	1.068520197145209
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
	1.0931117912519943
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
	1.0778537608968912
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
	0.0
an excellent library."
	1.000960277935337

	nan
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
	1.0966455519215978
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
	1.0698406101897737
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
	1.0622990861656307
towards him and said,
	0.9918939063574691

	nan
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
	1.0790486663293333
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
	1.0603754824912275
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
	1.0875185372442568
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
	1.0708735306369357
pleasure."
	nan

	nan
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
	1.0861375221388767
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
	1.079093806348862
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
	1.0753991887287866
cards."
	nan

	nan
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
	1.0611839590493124
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
	1.0374962609496892
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
	1.1079057039549205
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
	1.0551282039134287
day."
	nan

	nan
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
	1.0781022342068987
near so much like a ball."
	1.0261094089536447

	nan
Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
	1.0824419765452171
the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
	1.0938146275638612
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation
	1.0646306724018089
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
	1.067646467752779
Elizabeth, said,
	nan

	nan
"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
	1.0822886193576773
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
	1.037503981274405
so long in one attitude."
	1.0214557800305557

	nan
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
	1.0612598096379904
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
	1.0710693740045432
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
	1.0968465051138976
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
	1.0673893981898226
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
	1.0292762132774005
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
	1.0869929830774077
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
	1.0505909459585274
would interfere. "What could he mean? she was dying to know what could
	1.0859535024487428
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
	1.0597454874603474
him?
	nan

	nan
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
	1.0890210186994496
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
	1.0786024575534847
about it."
	0.9970426497502954

	nan
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any
	1.0759693950789235
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
	1.0464240023334843
motives.
	nan

	nan
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
	1.080196147519286
as she allowed him to speak. "You either chuse this method of passing
	1.0830926989873144
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
	1.0765986731645498
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
	1.0418897292936986
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
	1.0668720258819726
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
	1.0857913885042432
as I sit by the fire."
	1.032062186414295

	nan
"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard any thing so
	1.0735271574166763
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"
	1.0547577736442466

	nan
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We
	1.0822776713755728
can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him--laugh at
	1.0618445793596234
him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."
	1.080935479240146

	nan
"But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not
	1.1055744425441416
yet taught me _that_. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,
	1.0643380371404043
no--I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose
	1.0991030848103012
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.
	1.0575211417179866
Darcy may hug himself."
	1.016729036589822

	nan
"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an
	1.1027141592039749
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
	1.0654718817654059
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a
	1.1015104069088264
laugh."
	nan

	nan
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be. The
	1.0850439105072338
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
	1.0818477198399439
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
	1.062026858110086
joke."
	nan

	nan
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
	1.0734355507942648
not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies
	1.1074407541075646
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
	1.0697185596421628
laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
	1.0725705606136344
you are without."
	1.0006306399561358

	nan
"Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of
	1.1079540714359193
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
	1.0576101689895314
understanding to ridicule."
	1.0055198006458401

	nan
"Such as vanity and pride."
	1.024569079812954

	nan
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
	1.094822871214882
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."
	1.0611713264759908

	nan
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
	1.037241318889231

	nan
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
	1.076056623538979
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"
	1.0315658664211615

	nan
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
	1.1150459865252016
himself without disguise."
	0.9910278972957197

	nan
"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
	1.092838907471768
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
	1.0813895741517907
for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
	1.0872355783082555
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
	1.080169259984036
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My
	1.049614524831246
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
	1.0672229737202639
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost
	1.072076536309731
for ever."
	1.0013337896166425

	nan
"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment
	1.0610528342797654
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.--I
	1.1009637988951184
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me."
	1.0605598020644074

	nan
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
	1.0763565424212447
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."
	1.0582169354595181

	nan
"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."
	1.07069270865957

	nan
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
	1.0619693004055915
them."
	nan

	nan
"Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
	1.080807581063843
conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my
	1.0645037935871497
waking Mr. Hurst."
	1.020622289384306

	nan
Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
	1.0785798089176555
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
	1.0488580909882543
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.

CHAPTER XII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
	1.066947926341912
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
	1.0809317107519607
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
	1.1053096429816107
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
	1.0542907777334647
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
	1.0632580905087468
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
	1.0594698182917286
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
	1.0947734606714405
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
	1.0590895746121414
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
	1.0736159757056112
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
	1.0779372443467785
well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
	1.0470804632391304
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
	1.063209689976116
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
	1.0310971679377507
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
	1.0846158524815106
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
	1.039595725290829
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
	1.0576448282120783

	nan
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
	1.0573127424796798
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
	1.0934747344357911
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
	1.0865564142781716
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
	0.0
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
	1.0617929611424608

	nan
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
	1.0947383428267732
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
	1.0557137842357356
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
	1.0718286538628503
she felt herself to be right.
	1.0254620200874438

	nan
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
	1.071815110624494
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
	1.074772633508528
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.
	1.081343151916545
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
	1.070858520579053
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
	1.0709424164049168
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
	1.0633008233131545
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
	1.0493131726935154
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
	1.074978435034087
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
	1.0879838270959932
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
	1.0569405003455103
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
	1.0737437523872442

	nan
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
	1.0696290354441267
all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
	1.0751780192470082
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
	1.0770829740818613
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
	1.066757132321149
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
	1.0505657541786848
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of
	1.06772276502632
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.
	1.045705866845856

	nan
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
	1.090229000587476
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
	1.066747948079607
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their
	1.0565612180569548
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
	1.054388098131892
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
	1.0607798075337913
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
	1.0489811111000102
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
	1.0620397770669376
Elizabeth.
	nan

	nan
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
	1.0894170445636404
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
	1.0677114541133035
of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had
	1.0745181053505124
information for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much
	1.0542009159813566
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
	1.0793179913477022
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
	1.0701038183662754
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
	1.0709753189008828
to be married.

CHAPTER XIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
	1.0924693165925814
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
	1.0681004052731633
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."
	1.0619879773902807

	nan
"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
	1.096672420532973
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
	1.074293711955318
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."
	1.1003353199411705

	nan
"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.
	1.1000082848043948
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley
	1.1025780929808915
I am sure. Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!
	1.1011425885721622
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good
	1.1128264502129421
lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia,
	1.1132262959086032
my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment."
	1.0846235867294756

	nan
"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
	1.1025066784009845
never saw in the whole course of my life."
	1.0203324197714583

	nan
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
	1.070819144678585
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
	1.0557606856860835

	nan
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.
	1.0651569690593528
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
	1.0916963405633144
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
	1.0683594620505998
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
	1.0741674942056592
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."
	1.0386902090822543

	nan
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
	1.0847009856789438
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
	1.1116456627830338
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
	1.0802283570490865
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
	1.0900961899696149
to do something or other about it."
	1.0409593620396462

	nan
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
	1.0927916894294265
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.
	1.0888296953218948
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
	1.0754551596594326
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
	1.0708692411162875
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
	1.0727079894496567

	nan
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and
	1.0785080689987687
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
	1.0630961627141993
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
	1.0796906091156324
softened by his manner of expressing himself."
	0.0

	nan
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
	1.1015739008579752
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
	1.082715696988988
friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
	1.07077702004229
did before him?"
	1.001951039723628

	nan
"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
	1.0773172745807296
head, as you will hear."

     DEAR SIR,
	nan

	nan
     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
	1.0458571352887063
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
	1.0440289563233258
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
	1.0576420530366357
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
	1.063964598898528
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
	1.0754130661770003
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
	1.076375661166969
     variance.--"There, Mrs. Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on
	1.106619563823447
     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
	1.0690642791887683
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
	1.0727473160700116
     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
	1.0665843995084971
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
	1.044754362236088
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
	1.06865238068851
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
	1.056026167663922
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
	0.9985092392291952
     instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
	1.0831445302561797
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
	0.0
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
	1.0621569894127547
     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
	1.064906130782475
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
	1.0672997765437473
     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
	1.0524864880719331
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be
	1.0937450742180972
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
	1.0557896755233644
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
	1.0552312054975603
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
	1.0591362778108715
     of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me
	1.0782529851590739
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
	1.0375845069584753
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
	1.0655147799541267
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
	1.041945914476971
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
	1.0537524546659514
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
	1.0731694617540855
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
	1.06733782693436
     duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
	1.0781126502487508
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
	1.0474036505367395

	nan
     WILLIAM COLLINS."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
	1.0645609394462927
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most
	1.110263693597293
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
	1.0798053535641723
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
	1.0547711359530643
indulgent as to let him come to us again."
	1.0558456716000393

	nan
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
	1.0986662395491131
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
	1.0814910763763181
discourage him."
	0.997468429443601

	nan
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
	1.084929088122113
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
	1.099896150432791
credit."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
	1.0529299863350856
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
	1.0567335130265645
his parishioners whenever it were required.
	1.0285942499070924

	nan
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him
	1.0907335188818714
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
	1.0832281550650316
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
	1.0522589753109417
would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"
	1.0761074709927154

	nan
"No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
	1.1024594938347938
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
	1.0860806329205699
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."
	1.0517500836944143

	nan
"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
	1.0641381991759375
defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
	1.092291033146864
think it is well expressed."
	1.0177464680301918

	nan
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
	1.0829192744445115
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
	1.0470675169839478
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
	1.0793811835585467
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
	1.0644228831994857
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
	1.0909865914998398
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
	1.0810419989112925
astonished her husband and daughters.
	1.0022850835476893

	nan
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
	1.0858048851565685
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
	1.0898887606651793
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
	1.0699838961940114
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
	1.0737536272585206
heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and
	1.0582139080633226
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
	1.0748861571373762
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
	1.0623655945205221
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
	1.0470073590178817
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
	1.0714457170616474
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.
	1.0858251828075292
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
	1.092176270074561
Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,
	1.0677160497608484

	nan
"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
	1.1096564580297446
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
	1.0728461932891236
oddly."
	nan

	nan
"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."
	1.06276653150434

	nan
"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
	1.110827848243897
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
	1.0821787432649632
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
	1.097441807448958
will go when once they come to be entailed."
	1.0298955743072953

	nan
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
	1.0816615602045043
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
	1.0691892487510408
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
	1.0908287318347227
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps
	1.0624671236517762
when we are better acquainted----"
	1.0074598989997636

	nan
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
	1.0911179818908168
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The
	1.1099010927840578
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
	1.0685879475394424
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
	1.0802525298606407
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
	1.0695957127609403
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
	1.0690265086156365
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
	1.0881144404333287
cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured
	1.1062382729851195
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
	1.0756544443461606
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged
	1.1026545461767991
pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
	1.0667022773504666
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
	1.0639675013956533
quarter of an hour.

CHAPTER XIV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
	1.0808958891561904
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
	1.0604839649407998
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
	1.0485943797020996
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
	1.0766428654360534
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
	1.0732998636652167
comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
	0.0
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
	1.0907767649117537
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
	1.0809453602339434
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
	1.0780228337607392
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
	1.0552076097236271
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
	1.0630952535109366
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
	1.0650563999106728
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
	1.0730139281861697
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
	1.0990590749728157
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
	1.063732202153873
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.
	1.0715900773554465
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
	1.085505513807374
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
	1.076455455464771
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
	1.0437252891739288
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
	1.0872754622811962
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
	1.0624662789689994
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
	1.0471673236510184
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
	1.0650665420876229
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.
	1.0814300565548893

	nan
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I
	1.1048997469080486
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
	1.0800084484705488
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"
	1.0815301655478233

	nan
"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
	1.0819951555376417
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."
	1.0374582936524677

	nan
"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"
	1.0791424948963861

	nan
"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
	1.0781907865724245
extensive property."
	0.9807750263947368

	nan
"Ah!" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
	1.0868849677873056
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?"
	1.084278212853017

	nan
"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
	1.0878391279171147
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
	1.0891707556807912
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
	1.0718771954873914
the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
	1.0841156070765035
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
	1.0520370521489142
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
	1.0459592559838193
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
	1.0564469348720817
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
	1.074241064280438
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."
	1.078043141550453

	nan
"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
	1.0888173914538002
court."
	nan

	nan
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
	1.062346311324981
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
	1.0878942644915262
the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
	1.0800608917936023
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
	1.09630647618587
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
	1.042101735812368
ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
	1.073515867781409
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
	1.063450745417531
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
	1.0465225344479903
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
	1.085334820578601
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
	1.0744911755633657
pay."
	nan

	nan
"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you
	1.0896601418872474
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
	1.0813630481901186
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
	0.0
moment, or are the result of previous study?"
	1.0354513193773907

	nan
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
	1.0799496495564103
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
	1.0485676581641947
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
	1.0418362241334258
give them as unstudied an air as possible."
	1.0330547891094786

	nan
Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
	1.0885242852176622
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
	1.0683281459224205
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
	1.0611401477912457
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
	1.070730661855913
his pleasure.
	1.0021333867531224

	nan
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to
	1.1062725484323708
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
	1.0696966665610177
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,
	1.1117655316142963
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
	1.076769182755914
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
	1.065091533283532
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and
	1.0694158743673219
Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
	1.0661914025351504
he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
	1.0870040316652623
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
	1.0465964256286993
interrupted him with,
	0.9981654629816371

	nan
"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
	1.073493218208963
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so
	1.0945405522020952
herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
	1.0824288568901363
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."
	1.0778097635060608

	nan
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
	1.0942254022323206
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,
	1.0447163700373383

	nan
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
	1.0676689651056173
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
	1.0782856775209628
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
	1.046425524551044
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."
	1.0787552996921648

	nan
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
	1.0766400606752473
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
	1.060440058627509
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.
	1.0915829402207946
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
	1.0527373866393694
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
	1.0503673983598967
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
	1.0856577558358478
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
	1.068967267439085
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
	1.0653537096834758
for backgammon.

CHAPTER XV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
	1.093466422445257
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
	1.0650866458328023
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
	1.0617181090628958
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
	1.07156847981434
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
	1.0701960322175461
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
	1.0694402724759535
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
	1.0476417076636237
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
	1.036516745112982
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
	1.0361656961487085
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
	1.0624258708844962
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
	1.0877843938680418
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
	0.0
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
	1.083325109839043
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
	1.0530706649255517
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
	1.0314504080074216

	nan
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
	1.0733105526095237
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
	1.0689845665328548
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
	1.102632833836495
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
	1.059723274461327
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
	1.0733251658482477
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
	1.043316843936552
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
	1.041478878342926
part.
	nan

	nan
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face
	1.0841462616217556
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
	1.0499585386379169
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
	1.0762521323100858
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
	1.0671414080379191
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
	1.0872363860527823
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
	1.024995451191209
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
	1.0962866066987658
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
	1.0572593575428537
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to
	1.079564372904307
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
	1.0708635741796462
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
	1.0588430978697805
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
	1.0505685727952545
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."
	1.0556497601141077

	nan
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
	1.1046922945934452
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
	1.0844715620824399
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
	1.0640625308017133

	nan
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
	1.0949772861935931
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
	1.086898814643423
the day before, was now high in her good graces.
	1.0627102977617877

	nan
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
	1.0741170348646263
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
	1.086447471449609
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
	1.1058022445743996
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
	1.0796162346511797
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
	1.0359990674999289
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
	1.0935284724018517
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
	1.0800782582945412
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
	1.072661549529095
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
	0.0
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
	1.082769561045154
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
	1.0604959160936012
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
	1.0875170674693115
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
	1.068485870219476
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
	1.067191169025642
go.
	nan

	nan
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
	1.078589474914512
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
	1.0521056537855014
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes
	1.0963773920418678
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
	1.064719953039056
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
	1.0875031283671128
in a shop window, could recal them.
	1.0368630814608097

	nan
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
	1.0940207649897065
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
	1.040959992844291
with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very
	1.1111359126939548
Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
	1.0788674308307282
and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,
	1.0933580914967804
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
	1.0591908883259047
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
	1.0742620036236374
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
	1.0497166920543575
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
	1.0815284181849723
spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
	1.0616340218702687
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
	0.0
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
	1.0668292915958462
their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
	1.0896345850488183
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was
	1.0546504923743074
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
	1.080183545819553
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction
	1.052536955060254
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
	1.072066667355572
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
	0.0
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
	1.0332439167692014
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
	1.073671825512872
seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
	1.0701513265983507
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
	1.0634448828218346
civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
	1.0565371157982988
principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
	1.0779201207036873
purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
	1.0806566742254555
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
	1.0729881668089178
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
	1.0607150545182815
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
	1.079062646716631
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
	1.0833204259055116
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,
	1.0864426988917808
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.
	1.0734245292685352
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was
	1.0898415929106773
impossible not to long to know.
	1.0133866310869857

	nan
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
	1.0807337697064066
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
	1.033446880679532

	nan
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
	1.120798174856709
Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
	1.1070484446710263
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
	0.0
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
	1.0581121288669277
invitation.
	nan

	nan
Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
	1.1027001973173278
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
	1.043479626755327
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
	1.0394161225109873
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
	1.060278339370887
she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had
	1.1206776953954058
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
	1.0603358653480228
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
	1.061223862179712
towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with
	1.0900683045712007
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
	1.056651838891117
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
	1.030621133897733
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
	1.0485253999470223
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
	1.0563789210998615
her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
	1.091738694178578
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
	1.057271194018294
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
	1.0632479949221936
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
	1.0742816495407184
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
	1.0437270785053177
commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,
	1.0774587494403638
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham
	1.0908367864323514
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
	1.0504222448891325
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
	1.0762129730617862
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
	0.0
disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
	1.0676816743236468
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
	1.0742780606205742
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
	1.0746148978478949
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips
	1.0895579386752072
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
	1.0637607512445282
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
	1.081660491230009
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
	1.067779057551283
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
	1.0711692285306753
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
	1.0445483437100977

	nan
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
	1.0748474212986592
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
	1.0699969978701436
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
	1.0601704191894887
behaviour than her sister.
	1.0080589831736702

	nan
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
	1.1036314094181217
Philips's manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady
	1.0692467443674694
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
	1.0769710416642495
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
	1.0785333344757924
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
	1.0634421634073168
utterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed
	1.0693163822079284
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
	1.0887059238826213
attention in the whole course of his life.

CHAPTER XVI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
	1.0896480133009923
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
	1.1069240602408565
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
	1.064912366242524
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
	1.0649442950510273
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
	1.047912227841792
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
	1.0879047952951435
the house.
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
	1.0788159172659106
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
	1.0921714116516519
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
	0.0
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
	1.0289047168492862
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
	1.0564775347334416
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings
	1.0646462208277785
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
	1.0612548029146571
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
	1.0678802039125608
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
	1.0883107887312453
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
	1.0731189773133178
with the housekeeper's room.
	1.0288778688379088

	nan
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
	1.0854560726731166
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
	1.071784639773495
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
	1.0502969879109554
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive
	1.0634259997340856
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
	0.0
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
	1.062189893371238
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
	1.0763915977377103
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
	1.0839980936951552
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
	1.0614629309971144
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The
	1.0699885159558202
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
	1.0623471072967303
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
	1.0649563753221185
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The
	1.073134539167502
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
	0.0
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
	1.0594079398042155
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
	1.086805890659404
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
	1.050395301728356
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
	1.058318207333986

	nan
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
	1.0942998334504264
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
	1.067597756755464
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
	1.0452065522686544
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
	1.0558148101889595
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
	1.048896899624753
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
	1.0580627652401895
skill of the speaker.
	1.012342781801002

	nan
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the
	1.1097764839955908
officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
	0.0
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
	1.061935280073823
kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
	1.0500789888873499
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
	1.006331212180544

	nan
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
	1.076923541913545
in return, by sitting down to whist.
	1.0302764724902795

	nan
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
	1.0967973675641591
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs. Philips was
	1.0822267721455068
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
	1.0742930671221942

	nan
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
	1.0852939751803292
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
	1.0553801384132204
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
	1.071421486579183
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
	1.0415021184686786
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
	1.0902744298438083
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
	1.0646856440490546
particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was
	1.078192438871461
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
	1.0604593627797272
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
	1.062594443690842
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
	1.0957980273189452
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
	1.0448561805777061
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
	1.083806579554999
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
	1.0647400599027113
an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
	1.0736022499226623

	nan
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
	1.0710513650901485
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
	1.0733534835791074
understand."
	nan

	nan
"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
	1.0943072764188597
thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of
	1.0858990015543555
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
	1.0576410697650669
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."
	1.0468892192090071

	nan
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
	1.0298176290678405

	nan
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
	1.0679932216202952
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
	1.0593453166369793
yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"
	1.051884297655343

	nan
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
	1.0858503435480267
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
	1.077735731774376
disagreeable."
	nan

	nan
"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
	1.0892535514172192
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
	1.0926350272617167
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to
	1.0995995513694379
be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
	1.0721920391351065
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
	1.030157962620799
anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."
	1.0562422107180487

	nan
"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
	1.1119919627746426
neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
	1.0378571370569245
Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
	1.096095722736999
him more favourably spoken of by any one."
	1.029871638931592

	nan
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
	1.0627666990888531
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
	1.0491528849826162
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
	1.0735987135465883
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
	1.069728596055804
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."
	1.0730909506810624

	nan
"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
	1.0717547757990626
ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.
	1.0326584164200634

	nan
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
	1.0811646180443542
likely to be in this country much longer."
	1.0366923064291238

	nan
"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
	1.0989751820476787
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
	1.0892379105339953
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."
	1.052945967552212

	nan
"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
	1.1247977219310195
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
	1.0274397313845842
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
	1.084443221438992
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
	1.0715971815893166
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
	1.0860015750892948
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
	1.106729450630971
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
	1.0976992891011865
in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
	1.1029580166793662
thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
	1.044716779263578
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
	1.077796544193339
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
	1.0269314382984982
of his father."
	1.0098446710913227

	nan
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
	1.0721187187106578
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.
	1.0682524962015987

	nan
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
	1.0742911108560826
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
	1.0376746245096977
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
	1.0755886621887274
very intelligible gallantry.
	1.0084575755167713

	nan
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
	1.077457933807903
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a
	1.107543665953154
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
	1.0448979333013955
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
	1.0370538210620457
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.
	1.0483086336580345
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
	1.1010493095394014
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
	1.0810574774836605
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
	1.078302318750924
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
	1.0845183286481008
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
	1.0893738173821883
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
	1.0538439994103972
were speaking of just now."
	1.015789456842602

	nan
"Indeed!"
	nan

	nan
"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
	1.0988995203153409
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
	1.094610503595689
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
	1.0996345091861222
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
	1.0845833716816924
elsewhere."
	nan

	nan
"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could
	1.0593261973854335
his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"
	1.051130066540521

	nan
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
	1.0975895705101517
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
	1.0829111555646145
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
	1.095071561864191
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
	1.0631880196785768
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.
	1.068814877948
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
	1.0956252617371511
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
	1.1028319536413487
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
	1.048698318760365
any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
	1.1002374183229118
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
	1.0487498122281809
freely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very
	1.097307018546829
different sort of men, and that he hates me."
	1.0348097071891593

	nan
"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."
	1.0658542528787387

	nan
"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
	1.0964795602756578
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."
	1.0482892571121538

	nan
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
	1.0614531649373125
ever as he expressed them.
	1.0012793814424077

	nan
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
	1.0775671394209834
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"
	1.0221284500306231

	nan
"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
	1.070288030850901
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
	1.0780152079308913
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
	1.0557540837661454
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not
	1.0778679053746856
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
	1.098293970435879
preference which was often given me."
	0.9890087313618906

	nan
"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
	1.1037533347499358
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
	1.084157469824636
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
	1.0337528265798617
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
	1.0503842715777147
this!"
	nan

	nan
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember
	1.0646387709255214
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
	1.067570286630649
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must
	1.0649710771755572
be dreadful."
	0.9989171881247588

	nan
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
	1.0778444430539764
hardly be just to him."
	1.0057341665499488

	nan
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
	1.0666073335251058
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
	1.0867722038107657
father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very
	1.0677288410128465
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
	1.0279930174353635
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
	1.06669063770112
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
	1.059279026388176
manner!"
	nan

	nan
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
	1.090167102004823
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
	1.0602984276911667
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
	1.0781858354589895
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,
	1.0605676781994773
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
	1.1002597022227447
to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
	1.1191872590844851
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
	1.0894407660441592
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
	1.0522343736238962
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
	1.0576670388030032
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
	1.0884264449995855
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
	1.0703481623159823
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."
	1.0861088408797297

	nan
"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable!--I wonder that the very
	1.0781483131154626
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better
	1.099790514706262
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
	1.0623345224989529
dishonesty I must call it."
	1.0252912385821877

	nan
"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
	1.0647370989953906
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has
	1.090383815174079
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none
	1.045867913537351
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
	1.0646562792082563
impulses even than pride."
	1.0163952048740104

	nan
"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"
	1.0640857574060232

	nan
"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
	1.1016449094110923
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
	1.0521683932994106
the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
	1.1066129760432117
his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
	1.0930330551548018
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
	1.0748200004975432
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
	1.0783804027405588
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
	1.0678413927779893
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
	1.0804133724844283
most attentive and best of brothers."
	1.0186486405133446

	nan
"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"
	1.0428617843509704

	nan
He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain
	1.1104228325349133
to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,--very,
	1.1102458606402827
very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
	1.071094982353369
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
	1.0068564877493071
amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about
	1.1089310725533128
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her
	1.0536186284167346
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
	1.0847156701886032
and superintends her education."
	1.018779512324705

	nan
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
	1.0701707743041424
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,
	1.0449344195577666

	nan
"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
	1.0930087279641312
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
	1.056880072409508
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you
	1.0793235961223155
know Mr. Bingley?"
	1.003653308767705

	nan
"Not at all."
	1.0100210085323695

	nan
"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
	1.0995148056542812
Darcy is."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not
	1.094433200217876
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
	1.0685470226622138
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
	1.0961446872241059
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride
	1.0925373282533288
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
	1.0291318151764646
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
	1.0019481479698218
something for fortune and figure."
	1.0167294589478038

	nan
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
	1.0634701408412068
the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
	1.0856430307774456
Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were
	1.0945001781465336
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
	1.092080514225151
but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
	1.075852543115159
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
	1.0756568716995383
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
	1.0890957617484154
make herself uneasy.
	0.998538806113942

	nan
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
	1.0829426944966414
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
	1.024122288482491
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
	1.0771883183581552
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
	1.0714522804684483
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
	1.0729963536398692
little matters."
	1.001787794356831

	nan
Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
	1.089814559881394
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
	1.0738755344048168
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
	1.0604025646450899

	nan
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
	1.071992370039895
living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
	1.0855720765450048
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."
	1.0344645052648243

	nan
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
	1.0806006822885172
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."
	1.084369087105476

	nan
"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
	1.0977564146761682
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
	1.0679132629655406
yesterday."
	nan

	nan
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
	1.086958852913127
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."
	1.0477786973813674

	nan
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
	1.062634249999215
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
	1.0848569445917724
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
	0.0
self-destined to another.
	0.9868690795853247

	nan
"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
	1.0850961099377028
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
	1.0589017408582204
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
	1.0854823590791303
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
	1.0332585308916509

	nan
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
	1.0891656165178123
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
	1.0917185896812736
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
	1.080513766637387
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
	1.0552062709172272
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
	1.0778709503594033
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
	1.0805007722990907
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
	1.0631256564474192
the first class."
	1.0143552351964502

	nan
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
	1.077098501411308
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
	1.0347393758828256
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
	1.0992604976895948
Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of
	1.0859453584977892
Mrs. Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
	1.0837633189981548
body. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
	1.0593348341372837
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
	1.0867878993196651
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
	1.0923900843343335
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
	1.102678887845143
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
	1.0589514540261513
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
	1.0662220217008171
fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and
	1.1000467941855334
Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
	1.0901334053508192
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
	1.0585109870623535
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
	1.0812993848562027
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.

CHAPTER XVII.
	1.0045069902274852

Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.
	1.0826387723698712
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
	1.0646563335472334
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
	1.0778540780230972
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
	1.085291121083532
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The
	1.0654549287455894
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
	1.0607832960319996
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
	1.0457478445703166
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
	1.1008137659813313
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
	1.0565299918672397
otherwise explained.
	1.0031020373446984

	nan
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
	1.0851538832232375
other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
	1.072303434062307
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
	1.0737966979464444
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
	1.0431803968976847
without actual blame on either side."
	1.0243554783074063

	nan
"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
	1.0904577294716733
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
	1.0701449842574673
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
	1.068692638194042
somebody."
	nan

	nan
"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
	1.0804261605568057
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
	1.0579203654806462
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
	1.0919939100142317
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is
	1.0555957510297576
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
	1.0776603458283238
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
	1.0495727295341108
excessively deceived in him? oh! no."
	1.023305669525044

	nan
"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than
	1.0878077389974405
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
	1.0997692272954471
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it
	1.0551056184309986
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
	1.0982702115710747
looks."
	nan

	nan
"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to
	1.089799034617474
think."
	nan

	nan
"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."
	1.0654061500502137

	nan
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
	1.0806329774226957
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
	1.0862633105203636
affair became public.
	1.0033667498004273

	nan
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
	1.0707792504279745
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
	1.0666644317270775
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their
	1.071974024272898
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
	1.0507039023063633
fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see
	0.0
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
	1.0536635117769877
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
	0.0
separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
	1.0658154273419937
avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
	1.0625116021282388
and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from
	1.0990709276704593
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
	1.0556840878193183
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.
	1.0723849036387834

	nan
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
	1.0664690742883165
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
	1.0814144201232794
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
	1.0447802446730137
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
	1.0559256526003422
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
	1.0260898205223017
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
	1.0642159313620425
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
	1.0716950954123243
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's
	1.0940833324333643
looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
	1.0573496028366516
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
	1.0653612492388986
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.
	1.0670047591452019
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
	1.0888396574632
a ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family
	1.1075845247263085
that she had no disinclination for it.
	1.042320276786486

	nan
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I
	1.096673657770536
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
	1.0515258674471615
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
	1.088891967231522
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
	1.0171920119054325
body."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
	1.0836537538991984
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
	1.0768989988723507
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he
	1.050600719617493
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
	1.067713995817157
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
	1.0642043571523228
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
	1.042198192038141
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
	1.0609321441953903
dance.
	nan

	nan
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
	1.1001875226924036
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
	1.073257829638063
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
	1.0673687411460804
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
	1.097649738170033
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
	1.0891094811225674
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
	1.0449267987351027
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
	1.029385928866976
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."
	1.0373034470614468

	nan
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
	1.0655185745993156
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr. Collins
	1.0737816587568092
instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help
	0.0
for it however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force
	1.0927543909029362
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as
	1.0780180450112953
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
	1.0903682612896837
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first
	1.0697495454730732
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
	0.0
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
	1.0701778554327432
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
	1.0493928091097948
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
	1.0626624440731534
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
	1.0402967689469582
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
	1.0492081450587638
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
	1.0653902531967567
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
	1.070474693564372
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth however did not chuse to
	1.0641605657091182
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
	1.0682048340682322
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
	1.083235617283993
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
	1.0484379270230888

	nan
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
	1.0968185347129094
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
	1.0733036161099319
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
	1.1085174059785379
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No
	1.0911776193300864
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
	1.0561329291937906
for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some
	1.080374986175465
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
	1.0467484170528314
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
	1.0671174604573355
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
	1.081227381077768
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.

CHAPTER XVIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
	1.0739906226674403
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
	1.0765855123208794
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of
	1.077821279190234
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
	1.0585978836748322
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
	1.056883843261454
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
	1.062668776896544
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
	1.0743338353700265
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
	1.0837604677364951
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
	1.0695582474316845
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
	1.063073755723867
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
	1.0736508651496406
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
	1.07368273754045
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
	1.072965016567703
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
	1.0719523456712778
smile,
	nan

	nan
"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
	1.0807441810140543
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."
	1.058626504326548

	nan
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
	1.0728605341245325
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
	1.0750513291236536
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
	1.0789829252569971
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
	1.0550304084240063
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
	1.0379488908899686
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
	1.042944542863631
make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
	1.0493376838266322
Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
	1.0836764414383562
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
	1.0643744492189557
surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality
	1.0660066483996944
provoked her.
	0.9997576685070965

	nan
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
	1.0730450335480826
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
	1.0889494024556268
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
	1.0773032131348652
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
	1.0894731617114497
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
	1.0824741260619406
notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
	1.0604105342937116
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
	1.0544002724974026
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
	1.0296891543582114
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
	1.0762546699431612
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
	1.0806305434571384
him was ecstacy.
	0.9970267015862578

	nan
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
	1.0825980021927195
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
	1.0788040973825563
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
	1.0614592330941426
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
	1.0796736785396195
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
	1.073604861415785
knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
	1.0565592345086037
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
	1.0738831331145358
mind; Charlotte tried to console her.
	1.022452728615083

	nan
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
	1.0424890778896805

	nan
"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To
	1.068494544159073
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me
	1.0684127887168382
such an evil."
	1.0090211186921059

	nan
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
	1.0696786037030293
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
	1.0773884774766074
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
	1.0682977162080665
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
	1.1016208120466742
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
	1.0801752482548461
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
	1.0906467230055599
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
	1.0269518953400463
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
	1.0791340429427054
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
	1.0831490648700248
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
	1.0702833816348283
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
	1.0842887259548175
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.
	1.0797325212788733
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with
	1.0830186691138415

	nan
"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about
	1.103835542804197
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
	1.1024392487043095
the room, or the number of couples."
	1.0494027090275653

	nan
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
	1.0836945530417261
said.
	nan

	nan
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I
	1.1119155950527682
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
	1.0289155975062152
ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."
	1.0417285407898635

	nan
"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"
	1.0475336981834862

	nan
"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
	1.111352851788687
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
	1.066254253834771
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
	1.0588864707539758
trouble of saying as little as possible."
	1.020293181540456

	nan
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
	1.0774343471506889
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"
	1.0196011048373599

	nan
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
	1.0642186575257646
similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,
	1.0839727726559976
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
	1.0521908437639507
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
	1.0683752744239874
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
	1.054977501033992

	nan
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
	1.0829919363030636
said he. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
	1.0969315716552224
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."
	1.0250986817550516

	nan
"I must not decide on my own performance."
	1.0455456877564202

	nan
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
	1.0833704879995036
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
	1.0917139308881176
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
	1.0666885610787682
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
	1.088815810062041
been forming a new acquaintance."
	1.015545746932556

	nan
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
	1.0683708276140766
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
	1.048422910853048
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
	1.10156041132027
constrained manner said,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
	1.0824169598809739
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
	1.0380917836326233
is less certain."
	1.0062897355808043

	nan
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
	1.074860637002222
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
	1.087252585918404
his life."
	1.0021333867531224

	nan
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
	1.08625174990982
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
	1.0722141530927083
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
	0.0
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
	1.0922327178370692
dancing and his partner.
	1.0102409001109367

	nan
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very
	1.0761004326541006
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
	1.085977274045248
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
	1.0835715287011976
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
	1.0617099673278694
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
	0.0
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will
	1.0644806809527
then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
	0.0
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
	1.0718171976118893
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."
	1.0422743781567492

	nan
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
	1.079884558323523
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
	1.0855291848711137
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
	1.0456278178974803
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
	1.05363483161306
he turned to his partner, and said,
	1.0270399287637642

	nan
"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."
	1.0886177292112595

	nan
"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
	1.0941270681515922
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
	1.0766891893792492
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
	1.0617385387710208
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."
	1.0567028959002214

	nan
"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.
	1.0439357848329387

	nan
"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
	1.1191843643176231
feelings."
	nan

	nan
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
	1.1030845587268896
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."
	1.0687570610136867

	nan
"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
	1.104791881034569
something else."
	0.9992262063716364

	nan
"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
	1.0613273180823364
with a look of doubt.
	1.0259628732670996

	nan
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
	1.0615722567666488
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
	1.061559379558379
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
	1.0744070967421497
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
	1.0582400920448731
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
	1.0759388649811752
created_."
	nan

	nan
"I am," said he, with a firm voice.
	1.0451525752398731

	nan
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"
	1.0459293671678338

	nan
"I hope not."
	1.0094695195608527

	nan
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
	1.0631398347586596
to be secure of judging properly at first."
	1.0472120913791616

	nan
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"
	1.0402356102972397

	nan
"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
	1.0612864004307274
to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."
	1.0852943641455464

	nan
"And what is your success?"
	1.0179247789395163

	nan
She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different
	1.112147664632046
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."
	1.0289258552820577

	nan
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
	1.0561729089750629
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
	1.0778587669624045
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
	1.0850691335214373
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
	1.052750383323969

	nan
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
	1.0858789995683784
opportunity."
	nan

	nan
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.
	1.0870159983098506
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
	1.0882238646684386
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
	1.0644262906875308
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
	1.0688159174607748
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
	1.055352666143113
another.
	nan

	nan
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
	1.074272038689934
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,
	1.0282725708891272

	nan
"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
	1.059982897328697
Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
	1.090521150994336
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
	1.0754676612243061
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
	1.0661943948447603
late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
	1.0823871906610576
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.
	1.0903318143328342
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
	1.0928686575180986
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
	1.048531893630663
treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the
	1.0844991669333939
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to
	1.0917797189062748
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
	1.064278090371165
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
	1.0466769412389734
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
	1.0703228027799792
taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a
	1.0710299064174387
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
	1.0834885500988793
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
	1.0768205336802423
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."
	1.0590236889179172

	nan
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
	1.0879812149007522
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
	1.0663106980542985
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
	1.1000144437271617
assure you, he informed me himself."
	1.0193400986793493

	nan
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
	1.0825072558549182
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."
	1.0483002126215506

	nan
"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if
	1.0760720309020155
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
	1.079928258502723
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
	1.0736585174505664
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
	1.0789855473082732
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
	1.0978011881979044
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
	1.062408382878236
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
	1.0592129027514754
evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
	1.0528101142077027
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
	1.0516215645616729
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
	1.0721344722317143
happiness.
	nan

	nan
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
	1.094727819304918
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
	1.0821373840674378
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
	1.0658131375068884
you may be sure of my pardon."
	1.0222492239070982

	nan
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
	1.0695502642551917
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
	1.083906271712212
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
	1.0417334009424504
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
	1.0663995397537862
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
	1.0794018412728965
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
	1.1008113893443805
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
	1.0692112039476285
sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am
	1.1056930343275155
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's
	1.087463541973706
regard."
	nan

	nan
"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"
	1.0573592809893022

	nan
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."
	1.0684322983742283

	nan
"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
	1.0948676907612775
perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"
	1.0293634202176785

	nan
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
	1.0626089161681296
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
	1.0890998011005348
him _conditionally_ only."
	0.9970813173934704

	nan
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
	1.0930135324272006
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
	1.074630060330829
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
	1.0955215633470043
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
	1.0469092052950195
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
	1.0752900564463563
both gentlemen as I did before."
	1.0173088649776494

	nan
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
	1.0818101872234376
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
	1.0635122261868475
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
	1.0516001222242608
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
	1.0828794104711232
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
	1.0848648208074323
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
	1.0817377266676673
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and
	1.074883527726526
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
	1.0657443081908866
make a most important discovery.
	1.0140558777182664

	nan
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
	1.0829024520702044
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
	1.0995245491978638
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
	1.0304648152539684
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
	1.083053841195262
Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
	1.0728257909255459
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
	1.06237176723264
Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
	1.0819309050413008
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
	1.0997820211695606
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
	1.0780383747626903
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."
	1.0425228873018846

	nan
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?"
	1.0621815635432446

	nan
"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
	1.1064224673786571
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
	1.1107233565886043
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."
	1.0620949403716204

	nan
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
	1.0776954516674946
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
	1.0732191565059293
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
	1.0624614850363447
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
	1.080150941276322
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
	1.0875425429602068
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her
	1.0708031782304832
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
	1.0773485423645417
ceased speaking, replied thus,
	0.9976359157857504

	nan
"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
	1.0966489291698966
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
	1.0321493226555105
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
	1.0683942065122032
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
	1.0653191472004495
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
	1.0806862162130029
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
	1.0838434883588417
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
	1.0806754389874198
same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
	1.08084718982599
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
	1.0821618962635395
on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
	1.0957045593598778
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
	1.0352017505760671
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
	1.076708625997954
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
	1.0803549460741368
yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
	1.0964883672035914
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
	1.0489400081117852
being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with
	1.070036359150084
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
	1.1033523306443058
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
	1.0733178290938503
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him
	1.0836108609094073
expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
	1.0664387128319384
wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
	1.079443755342654
with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not
	1.08028184977595
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
	1.0626027505440845
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
	0.0
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
	1.0887752844531018
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
	1.0219989898016584

	nan
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
	1.0815755767602961
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
	1.0874469995809022
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
	1.0695143544039567
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
	1.088242567986717
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
	1.0749328347954012
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."
	1.0469570693638939

	nan
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
	1.0902672777609423
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the
	1.0715092442437235
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
	1.0516242529783228
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
	1.0857189184342009
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
	1.085974315991168
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
	1.0369855034136455
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
	1.063627260167618
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
	1.08282701813617
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
	1.083388745999892
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
	1.0443573815337681
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
	1.0737857261504455
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
	1.0725353176388617
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
	1.0681735339844396
soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.
	1.0833786345511003
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
	1.0557155524605295
the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
	1.1042118596876418
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
	1.0646037859585886
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
	1.1026833052674982
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
	1.0906182223085392
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
	1.0866364412964735
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
	1.067705252489419
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
	1.0919543860539185
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
	1.0793364422017315
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
	1.1001066414937517
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
	1.0499290834407795
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
	1.0958454134114661
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She
	1.1029354517307788
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
	1.0558997100185907
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
	1.0289397630622201
chance of it.
	1.001443926868504

	nan
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
	1.0839359430224247
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
	1.0538288036889418
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
	1.0459049972475738
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
	1.0906587590374142
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
	1.0320315501873034

	nan
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
	1.1150176573920914
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
	1.0788533039629356
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."
	1.016756570762292

	nan
"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you
	1.0895859036684483
to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
	1.092606630712252
so doing."
	1.0035046423818217

	nan
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother
	1.0691298318376914
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed
	1.0774871031158495
and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
	1.0787357160609596
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
	1.0533119230881984
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
	1.0805687522269172
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
	1.0602936317756146
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
	1.0636970392308596
steady gravity.
	0.998648239459991

	nan
At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
	1.0994024055619338
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
	1.080827945075292
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
	1.0628084695406763
Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
	1.0844660309010958
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
	1.037111578122085
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
	1.0580481820744225
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
	1.0707767454822592
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
	0.0
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
	1.0472883106986048
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
	1.073965958052509
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
	1.0760061839888173
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
	1.0527697964165241
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
	1.0627940407029584
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
	1.0943832199726173
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
	1.0625580399143428
began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
	1.0537897071796396
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.
	1.0746613796360873
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
	1.0926919699459638
talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
	1.0677665705641866
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
	1.0679628283822873
impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
	1.0525551366889827
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
	1.0675908641934013
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,
	1.0563585268650202

	nan
"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
	1.0826986759877637
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."
	1.0595828580296962

	nan
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
	1.0517492164002642
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
	1.0804225880660752
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.
	1.1064849676224267

	nan
"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
	1.1071228638438415
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
	1.065488393650668
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
	0.0
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
	1.079008110901045
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
	1.0727284706439482
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
	1.060475021907833
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
	0.0
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
	1.0769128405784403
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
	0.0
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
	1.0850474098681229
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
	1.0621407448444549
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
	1.0781447216255369
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
	1.0544342952523256
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot
	0.9998493338215866
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
	1.0812978837853788
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
	1.0618545169684521
with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,
	1.1148857252840858
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many
	1.1007735629556756
stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet
	1.081242850396493
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having
	1.0408473164333514
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
	1.0693016067503356
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
	1.060499676208696

	nan
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
	1.0676854313056716
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
	1.0430196652508386
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
	1.0576549599720217
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
	1.061591130782249
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
	1.07716513262131
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
	1.0802624495675932
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
	1.0793380917039899
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
	1.062202670422956
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
	1.0724047939300643
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
	1.0635393383438179

	nan
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by
	1.0900690216972846
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
	1.080630592877959
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
	1.0877558244371093
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
	1.0952657563645485
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
	0.0
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
	1.0746961465336113
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
	1.0787399297452884
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
	1.0848183330038814
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
	1.1024694196189921
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
	1.0747414992110005
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.
	1.061371706141013

	nan
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;
	1.1052677988719706
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
	1.0343985658641273
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
	1.0692441136198325
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
	1.064559235257351
it.
	nan

	nan
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
	1.1057031916016022
manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
	1.0924438338526545
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
	1.0787013950914384
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
	1.0928010306517648
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
	1.0424747233656966
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
	1.0692267332597611
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
	1.0828448868824125
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
	1.0715752425131393
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
	1.0808217883313511
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
	1.0630422381272007
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
	1.0589059018011255
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
	1.0841788822284544
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
	1.0841306657400902
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
	1.054606530099606
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
	1.0864227472398873
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
	1.0409793946718846
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.
	1.044653045974423

	nan
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
	1.0862753005757912
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
	0.0
addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy
	1.0464214338036544
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
	1.074188686938566
without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful
	1.0731532786003373
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
	1.0548577979814013
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
	1.069136613325595
go the next day for a short time.
	1.0389875640507438

	nan
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
	1.0749451550127394
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
	1.0376476944227035
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
	1.0479050786635442
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
	1.070120997937953
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
	1.0713831838256433
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
	1.0576522400133601
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
	1.0925348436895141
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
	1.0829765830558418
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.

CHAPTER XIX.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
	1.0989684719570538
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
	1.0727574099801642
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
	1.0710223877853253
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
	1.073743218496498
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
	1.0704596710602212
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding
	1.0828851370137302
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
	1.07982992631434
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,
	1.032943154633352

	nan
"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
	1.0723717646993531
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
	1.08541827709672
course of this morning?"
	1.003234950625257

	nan
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
	1.0873811352409593
Bennet instantly answered,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
	1.0918729722737712
sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And
	1.0964079603807064
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
	1.0548582357847056
called out,
	nan

	nan
"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse
	1.1241910461107865
me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am
	1.1082919892190273
going away myself."
	0.9757144847010005

	nan
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And
	1.0932986023217381
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
	1.0562555958100566
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
	1.0737667334642904
Mr. Collins."
	1.0123111639599869

	nan
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
	1.06535547740593
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
	1.0580138663699135
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
	1.0306750429772034
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
	1.0614507488133416
between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
	1.0799524273514303
soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.
	1.0332407139555615

	nan
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
	1.0657270685108924
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
	0.0
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
	1.0758807602331382
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
	1.0437664417546264
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport
	1.0714118614646493
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
	1.0557460189132457
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
	1.0788409835846855
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
	1.0803136848321813
future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
	1.0700446222683713
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
	1.0404638719009096
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
	1.0594880613562874
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."
	1.0401131993342911

	nan
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
	1.0928205641316568
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
	1.0813573840499036
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
	1.068455965065693
he continued:
	nan

	nan
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
	1.085784961850326
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
	1.0552076926213598
of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
	1.0850365119609282
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
	1.0773835095006383
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
	1.0451371835518946
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.
	1.0978028392262467
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
	1.0825515259528842
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
	1.0566062790345905
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
	1.0610781767210469
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you
	1.0747377883651625
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a
	1.0750354676462497
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
	1.0737094872308457
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
	1.0665562076374204
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
	1.0938881343316766
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the
	1.0944380157118776
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
	1.0767870546792189
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
	1.0535206862202413
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any
	0.0
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
	1.0594344025558804
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
	1.0628171226170378
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
	1.0639075442602242
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
	1.069238980847479
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
	1.0588324900745305
assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
	1.0871032153046807
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
	1.0831806491868707
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
	1.0582202850636608
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
	1.0621299199995946
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
	1.074264372710906
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
	1.0176750898507987
for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
	1.0811426471925363
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
	0.0
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
	1.0702363695844193
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
	0.0
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
	1.0784882461649958
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
	1.0693906842468492
in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's
	1.1026194020819455
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
	1.073955440223477
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
	1.0502196751855792
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."
	1.0614177937381122

	nan
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
	1.0511011486068276

	nan
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no
	1.0972108434495553
answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for
	1.0893542481529506
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
	1.0970001872899726
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
	1.0741072718625535
them."
	nan

	nan
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
	1.1110196350114832
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
	1.0899282809227726
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
	1.0571107183161574
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
	1.078341951474199
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
	1.0757533915729935
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."
	1.0733804191401803

	nan
"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
	1.0633244457162405
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
	0.0
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
	1.080863402859776
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
	0.0
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_
	1.0783258748931774
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
	1.0731744581094556
would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
	1.091542522099175
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
	1.0618919147638528
situation."
	nan

	nan
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins
	1.0813298282546873
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
	1.0697836448788403
disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
	1.098863642819719
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
	1.074770412597756
economy, and other amiable qualifications."
	0.0

	nan
"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must
	1.090067289323804
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
	1.0646080925088772
believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
	0.0
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
	1.0786747561375776
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
	1.086324018972658
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
	1.0525826265006315
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be
	1.0349512703698036
considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus
	1.0522039820734532
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus
	1.0681988040433517
addressed her,
	nan

	nan
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
	1.101036966288157
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
	1.064151830060322
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
	1.0562056558848973
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
	1.100365967814134
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
	1.054334530673184
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
	1.0721260190999768
female character."
	0.9887267179925638

	nan
"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
	1.0772725723393093
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
	1.072936531409983
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
	1.0944092591834518
may convince you of its being one."
	1.0099110812196233

	nan
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
	1.072261034228199
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
	0.0
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
	0.0
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
	1.0632261321946863
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
	1.0696421276547008
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
	1.0857799370636856
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
	1.0430134985829493
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
	1.0578664492600538
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
	1.0557169767047498
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
	1.0717895101637405
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
	1.0520829548077582
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
	1.054977356689505
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
	1.0715577123105475
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."
	1.0485549037018749

	nan
"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
	1.084969431800411
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
	1.0720463993464142
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
	1.0490504916081878
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
	1.0771636491761714
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
	1.0748690771152511
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
	1.0637258777510836
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
	1.0388166225683455
truth from her heart."
	1.0017720437580981

	nan
"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
	1.058545777898338
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
	1.0503505337828059
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
	1.0615214928907888
being acceptable."
	0.9985294100298563

	nan
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
	1.0673296117329307
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
	1.0433257816237458
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
	1.020720407072362
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
	1.0527095699546576
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
	1.0791617915631566
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

CHAPTER XX.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
	1.0850712615412725
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
	1.0441561174750025
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
	1.0999480154611219
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
	1.0662315456196747
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
	1.0527652559269804
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
	1.0804345147749908
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
	1.0296883732517148
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
	1.054476951008583
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
	1.0696714221580288
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
	0.0
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
	1.0704478854216104

	nan
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been
	1.0655015097751446
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
	1.0399964361275
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
	1.0509843559218226
it, and could not help saying so.
	1.0302081358184152

	nan
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
	1.081045648544248
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is
	1.0801382578786267
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
	1.0762180984634493
I will _make_ her know it."
	1.0310089613938738

	nan
"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she
	1.075333555711626
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
	1.056956770320649
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
	1.0662047914560093
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
	1.0461270106150826
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
	1.0563055409670243
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
	0.0
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."
	0.0

	nan
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is
	1.0759898513961212
only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as
	1.087980938804923
good natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
	1.100020237814193
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."
	1.0611598320587103

	nan
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
	1.0750410644873833
husband, called out as she entered the library,
	1.0234875449196

	nan
"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
	1.0929907097728524
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will
	1.0991800475390032
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
	1.0864285757042325
not have _her_."
	1.0050420212323157

	nan
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
	1.096409877432127
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
	1.0939856029514414
her communication.
	1.001863189880847

	nan
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
	1.0777779659936353
finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"
	1.018286616040004

	nan
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
	1.110288635267357
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."
	1.0864501877444395

	nan
"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."
	1.1024697629842233

	nan
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
	1.0859245078593744
marrying him."
	0.9980873563236351

	nan
"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."
	1.0635895074394213

	nan
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
	1.0900912558263076
library.
	nan

	nan
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for
	1.0850089158245344
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
	1.0894536672719846
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.
	1.086163193764728
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"
	1.0562455346758386

	nan
"I have, Sir."
	1.0091630205777167

	nan
"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
	1.1096928064023823
accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?"
	1.0300711479481883

	nan
"Yes, or I will never see her again."
	1.0468044402047112

	nan
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
	1.0802643469317617
be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you
	1.0935207834373586
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
	1.091594533960872
if you _do_."
	1.0046383364435887

	nan
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
	1.0763758375418637
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
	1.0742360584441293
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
	1.0291089496062746

	nan
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me
	1.0947558862489009
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."
	1.0337811943069088

	nan
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.
	1.0780603121001748
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
	1.085125756944821
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
	0.0
library to myself as soon as may be."
	1.0334661800830074

	nan
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
	1.0703374332888773
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
	1.1077909240591737
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in
	1.088188056872289
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
	1.0400176972047859
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
	1.0432900477809774
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though her manner
	1.0740656575329826
varied however, her determination never did.
	1.0140999306583427

	nan
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
	1.0812262665769987
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
	1.07645851474322
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
	1.0749831618140886
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
	1.0778182249285746
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
	1.044907324108241

	nan
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
	1.0765630601949023
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
	1.1152307409271662
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
	1.092545096541802
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr. Collins has
	1.064202440293531
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."
	1.0565599436527848

	nan
Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
	1.0633665988973098
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
	1.0691918536062897
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
	1.0644570646038425
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
	1.066250523144174
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
	1.0907473257878606
family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
	1.0840345083298228
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
	1.0805493783590279
nobody feels for my poor nerves."
	0.994444794508554

	nan
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
	1.0877002584308002

	nan
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
	1.064928358659718
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
	1.0891936319610105
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
	1.1067146716610283
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
	1.08646893099109
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
	1.1010371038949136
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep
	1.1006844512439373
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I
	1.1074907268282772
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
	1.0682762987345726
again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in
	1.0895126633815078
talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
	1.06110489703645
talking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
	1.0662134856808587
can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I
	1.0627671812559132
suffer!--But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never
	1.0722418918513958
pitied."
	nan

	nan
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
	1.0640286196765385
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.
	1.0560133959596822
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
	1.0654460259538865
they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately
	1.07203287367525
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,
	1.0459906022689394

	nan
"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
	1.088402259517183
let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."
	1.0691775979895193

	nan
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
	1.0766724864276769
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
	1.0704663499583869
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
	1.0708140754834394
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
	1.0659986491279483
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
	1.0483918825291854
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
	1.098993389625329
conversation.--"Oh! Mr. Collins!"--
	1.0136899868165348

"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.
	1.0860674908307735
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
	1.0821575083715276
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to
	1.0537419291396848
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
	1.0624932181284301
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
	1.0748163813296476
trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
	1.0980860696241384
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
	1.0219421887868605
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
	1.0552772939084687
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
	1.038670008258504
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
	1.0691824673783854
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
	1.0561243629211283
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
	1.0621646358565962
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
	1.0563437706630072
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
	1.0623017955236307
from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to
	1.1008397181281535
error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object
	1.0873581562522754
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
	1.058041647288727
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
	1.0610416514595375
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."

CHAPTER XXI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
	1.0973985437969886
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
	1.0610889194083282
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
	0.0
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
	1.0629953605719062
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
	1.0666733439584177
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to
	1.0451651593038933
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
	1.0710362717262063
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
	1.06794342057824
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
	1.0700552393145786
especially to her friend.
	0.0

	nan
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or ill
	1.094771027691974
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
	1.101464828939813
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
	1.0727806229495975
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
	1.1031033975268156
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.
	1.0588140973555389

	nan
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
	1.0861506302694357
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
	1.0760437230693773
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
	1.0782304511017289
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
	1.0748538848410492
well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
	1.0493427269251645
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.
	1.0698308495323763

	nan
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
	1.0948876958588158
Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
	1.1288751963876165
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
	1.0663918907107917
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."
	0.9850267062754902

	nan
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
	1.0650454654958048
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
	1.0303405605963523
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
	1.041799297148291
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.
	1.071277716915209
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
	1.0615836205541611
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
	1.0551350772893313
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
	1.0493714320932788

	nan
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
	1.0778966148611624
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a
	1.0601673313664555
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
	1.0663319295457647
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
	1.0666585158433388
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
	1.070718711765023
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
	1.0628514164134153
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
	1.046976913452375
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
	1.0690650122692114
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
	1.0699274762308801
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they
	1.0879522541395115
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,
	1.0614525810902236

	nan
"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
	1.0752465580313109
good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
	1.0687342334988874
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.
	1.0822869694996697
You shall hear what she says."
	1.0307116280178656

	nan
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
	1.0594494897837308
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
	1.0667414045402361
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.
	1.0853292698211154
Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. "I do not pretend to
	1.1163915796892447
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
	1.0532684976944684
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
	1.0438894826673535
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
	1.06301897185765
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
	1.0669035662926243
unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these high
	1.0525657115436724
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
	1.0504754062737796
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
	1.0491812276839803
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
	1.0800553849066352
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
	1.078378062386516
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
	1.0858251886058023
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
	1.0332267453059882

	nan
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
	1.0888420973693351
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
	1.0920402344996956
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
	1.0550929641301894
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
	1.064291626626047
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
	1.0560035760125033
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
	1.0693063926385507
them."
	nan

	nan
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
	1.0641433118665313
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you--
	1.0553737063477624

	nan
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
	1.0690671934203246
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
	1.079567946185294
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
	1.078357389991385
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
	1.102811018606978
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
	1.0646100822970106
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are
	1.074760316063652
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
	1.073637281780054
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
	1.0780356350710136
despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
	1.076043101633886
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
	1.063821196391709
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
	1.0865153088352901
whom we shall deprive you."
	1.008859038210477

	nan
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
	1.086366369626776
winter."
	nan

	nan
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."
	1.075048331511868

	nan
"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.
	1.1158856504423555
But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
	1.0821812540032414
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr. Darcy
	1.0807822374731388
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
	1.0839977242262642
scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana
	1.0628314946728437
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
	1.0637065393647414
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
	0.0
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
	1.0636626182106705
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
	1.0780122741313556
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
	1.0751604887402444
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
	1.0112603506597801
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
	1.0596044912880775
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
	1.0691149589116125
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
	0.0
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
	0.0
capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to
	1.0721322915133649
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
	1.0595842767881634
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
	1.0842867547428061
of so many?"
	1.0040818234041304

	nan
"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she
	1.0756686654958716
finished it. "Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare
	1.0415129538962413
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
	1.0759902151236829
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
	1.064282240554205
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
	1.0791728784721168
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"
	1.055007248959879

	nan
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"
	1.0776670262296244

	nan
"Most willingly."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
	1.0939751605243313
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to
	1.096802813810456
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
	1.0883598887827703
does not care about you."
	1.0153390306242451

	nan
Jane shook her head.
	1.017751536880667

	nan
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you
	1.09210324301974
together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is
	1.0824785913559052
not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy
	1.1137406452721899
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is
	1.0869101251147455
this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
	1.0928118206777044
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
	1.077740578668158
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
	1.0595655579208658
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
	1.0711073639677446
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
	1.0700831074306483
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
	1.0521913281228272
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
	1.0760751432242788
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
	1.0469195854910032
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
	1.0915636096610681
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."
	1.0812987257509001

	nan
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
	1.0597479877640814
representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the
	1.080231179344181
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
	1.038972197882307
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
	1.0890360585030696
herself."
	nan

	nan
"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
	1.0962165417071215
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.
	1.0879068321865786
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
	1.0887986342904301

	nan
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
	1.0749785886632728
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
	1.0520933539115174
elsewhere?"
	nan

	nan
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
	1.0625520229564385
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
	1.0345612591455584
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
	1.0842944578340854
all means to refuse him."
	1.0171646828918557

	nan
"How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
	1.075979485217404
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
	1.041383836030523
not hesitate."
	1.0011509172513617

	nan
"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
	1.086380694636198
your situation with much compassion."
	1.02085742944154

	nan
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
	1.0741630801016826
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"
	1.0470770436088357

	nan
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
	1.0753973442707871
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
	1.069865393346244
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
	1.05780489878435
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
	0.9856959287376367
so totally independent of every one.
	1.033091542099719

	nan
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
	1.0756788463293647
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
	1.0864789425864225
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
	1.0774192401412774
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
	1.0421552548185087
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
	1.0812761389027012

	nan
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
	1.0913912674072963
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
	1.0727882749683442
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
	1.0611275787273458
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
	1.075002916933254
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
	1.0791638538856332
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
	1.0751573512434969
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
	1.0854808327913048
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
	1.071888513912247
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
	1.088798320251838
two full courses.

CHAPTER XXII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
	1.0883392286409566
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
	1.1066536913219944
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good
	1.08205726047509
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
	1.0617651956249277
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
	1.0641896100416897
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
	1.0965323309654824
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
	1.0535034569361845
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
	1.0783390213131718
from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
	1.0780234935468125
herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
	1.067903369013683
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
	1.0564789682365268
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
	1.083411347879856
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
	1.0777806034686916
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
	1.0453767412256774
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
	1.0554514762515856
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
	1.0829898301703924
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
	1.070660297056325
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
	1.0634040876500674
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
	1.0422515462899549
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
	1.0534263367014014
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His
	1.0618482853903615
reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived
	1.0517774461640057
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
	1.0580924832863667
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared
	1.0855954940484502
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
	1.0706549775128877

	nan
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every
	1.0968092101455191
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
	1.0640564984171965
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
	1.0693357878219394
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
	1.0940819364613257
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
	1.0887876346580854
happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
	1.0567662325010851
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
	1.0741976074269404
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
	1.0557293924681816
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
	1.0354500492006014
establishment were gained.
	0.9965650332377822

	nan
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
	1.0792049521107498
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present
	1.097113350757077
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
	1.0375523497611636
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
	1.0505543857702957
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
	1.042773153851723
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
	1.0533558349568248
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
	1.0988687360196983
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
	1.057233763080503
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
	1.0724527220148694
should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family in short
	1.0879110916173271
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
	1.0697055648306306
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
	1.0717760025182015
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
	1.0708003742418628
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
	1.0653135723888087
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
	1.0563848779722962
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
	1.082993927777124
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
	1.0569910007216736
imaginary. But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly
	1.0691953332146777
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
	1.0595022331818802
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
	1.0733358141153113
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
	1.0442773062234685
pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now
	1.0456868212895785
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
	1.0580925547323081
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable
	1.0513604266268772
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
	1.0508889822798029
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
	1.0594637619025857
person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
	1.0717794091658384
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
	1.077565699648501
disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and
	0.0
therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
	1.0597268893466247
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise
	1.1060036678892375
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
	1.078059540464311
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
	1.0595810505230001
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
	1.0489746685040764
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
	1.0713914482042235
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.
	1.020311232786435

	nan
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
	1.1175244062093042
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
	1.0726636510634957
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
	1.086395979262585
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
	1.0546580571553315
other engagements might allow him to visit them.
	1.0379790065126306

	nan
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
	1.0434756546740631
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
	1.073320163462815
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
	1.0654463213624474
possible."
	nan

	nan
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
	1.0962406722379732
so speedy a return, immediately said,
	1.022968960683109

	nan
"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
	1.0774973657598086
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
	1.0596950453045522
offending your patroness."
	0.9919086488881076

	nan
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
	1.0777124582536082
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
	1.0649058848216064
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."
	1.038686321510075

	nan
"You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her
	1.092086588697093
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
	1.072726701817488
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
	1.0543166030374214
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."
	1.0532864548370657

	nan
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
	1.0628424766245805
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
	1.0362297181733442
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
	1.0892425956824898
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,
	1.0704809297794116
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
	1.0588005533917177
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
	1.0733506519558242
my cousin Elizabeth."
	1.006129809556742

	nan
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
	1.0644243682716579
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished
	1.0478974395392064
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
	1.086276459672257
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
	1.0810288066982372
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
	1.0885621750595547
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
	1.050844318336302
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
	1.054926241534793
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
	1.0521686316022516
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
	1.0588100679784018
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
	1.072443986165358
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
	1.0733646664543377

	nan
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her
	1.0836431096355845
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
	1.0653836925574942
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
	1.0543275830976497
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
	1.0467506201190855
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
	1.0303156957733428
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,
	1.0515500040119368

	nan
"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"
	1.0508891301451486

	nan
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
	1.0635135293426667
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
	1.0207802408479005
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
	1.0386353708791312
regained her composure, and calmly replied,
	1.0257549531770855

	nan
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
	1.0706897655184475
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
	1.094405241059748
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"
	1.0420523194478486

	nan
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
	1.065482060468374
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
	1.0746307907879946
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
	1.0689319856386381
her all imaginable happiness.
	1.014643466158164

	nan
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
	1.0549227348845929
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to
	1.0346517828926967
marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
	1.091704151200745
will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I
	1.0880379262567959
never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's
	1.0610250911856165
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
	1.025924049106035
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
	1.0726270362188262
entering the marriage state."
	1.014211273123993

	nan
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
	1.0446051320432845
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
	1.075366147487318
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It
	1.0736857492544578
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
	1.0971874561177948
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers
	1.0922746319757473
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
	1.0614419393332406
now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
	1.080083569813297
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
	1.0706591678039878
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
	1.0501217824541875
better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,
	1.0705661445447392
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
	1.0831053525495282
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
	1.0530855074713312
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
	1.0818887240759927
she had chosen.

CHAPTER XXIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
	1.0611634983580198
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
	1.0672273014422227
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
	1.0560889307583308
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
	1.0584695835069295
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
	1.0739737350857868
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
	1.0509484818105834
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
	1.0510004126430001
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
	1.039960152097059
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,
	1.0100077581433684

	nan
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know
	1.093079987864995
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"
	1.045422592339863

	nan
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
	1.0662900498517738
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
	1.0554769579674386
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
	1.05111437971711
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
	1.051495961500732
most forbearing courtesy.
	1.0046557243612892

	nan
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
	1.0672557587057163
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
	1.062870774130388
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
	1.037430763818131
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
	1.0701642557542408
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
	1.079070891235782
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
	1.0898101671351141
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
	1.0536870530261784
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
	1.0903073285613731

	nan
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
	1.0992229831998903
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
	1.0734846411631729
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
	1.06513265813517
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
	1.094567462268241
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
	1.0701017501219328
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
	1.065128776508838
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
	1.0577496873321306
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
	1.0923166844748815
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
	1.0760520414695876
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
	1.0780655734540432
console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her
	1.0688380141945646
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
	1.0599395361973802
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
	1.051973025880181
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
	1.0770010362864204
could at all forgive their daughter.
	1.0215026740160242

	nan
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
	1.0952392467947265
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
	1.077162022593999
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
	1.0678307707115924
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
	1.0583885989362967
more foolish than his daughter!
	1.0071760577761815

	nan
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
	1.0751341077052525
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
	1.0493812301794703
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and
	1.0606329803311236
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
	1.0924632489496795
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
	1.0630596567658344
to spread at Meryton.
	1.0187090086068598

	nan
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
	1.084552018239216
Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
	1.0872296364971878
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
	1.0424852328910663
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
	1.0728682274983665
enough to drive happiness away.
	1.0154344188346764

	nan
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
	1.0656328413196063
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
	1.0724212168207774
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
	1.0313657999639951
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
	1.0423220633361363
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
	1.059073021122337
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
	1.0287909612607782
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.
	1.0962167259789153

	nan
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
	1.0809853158236424
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
	1.0832269856010872
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
	1.0666422899302406
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
	1.0624798218135172
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
	1.0608855518655218
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
	1.0601742463801107
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
	1.0421559209446007
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
	1.0681642950207397
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
	1.0700822842119693
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
	1.0745006245180262
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
	1.0724801784998537
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
	1.0645551347428743
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
	1.0275901270959251
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
	1.061267503637768
the happiest of men.
	1.020118536334425

	nan
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
	1.0874688548406524
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to
	1.0948995760982012
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come
	1.071466085942115
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
	1.0794354891826141
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house
	1.0652503097334487
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
	1.0673836311906075
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they
	1.0859051113774658
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
	1.0627440879376082
absence.
	nan

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
	1.0740605906953182
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
	1.0476340977284426
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
	1.0607271628522643
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
	1.0647145148827657
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
	1.0699250613332523
falsehood.
	nan

	nan
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
	1.0724571729572456
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she
	1.0736908152858722
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
	1.0797515049607689
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
	1.0519565529134494
frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
	1.0514851678201949
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
	1.0681656382381166
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
	1.083441914664596
the strength of his attachment.
	1.0253582976548277

	nan
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
	1.0724589787009626
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
	1.0477689330703535
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
	1.0491248613928286
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
	1.0821883680907942
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
	1.0408475562982542
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
	1.0733185417330342
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all
	1.0896303598311003
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
	1.0589718328691333
tranquillity.
	nan

	nan
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
	1.0778131025692743
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
	1.0667645931365153
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
	1.0683613780218066
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
	1.0779052295897986
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
	1.0992171991571626
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
	1.0629518994896596
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
	1.0926567739985238

	nan
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any
	1.1118941957233555
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
	1.0644913462047563
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of
	1.072398206572927
Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
	1.0933849890595204
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
	1.0586932261431121
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
	1.0660768169207502
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
	1.0760643806042194
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
	1.0571811496722732
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
	1.112703189612898
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
	1.0492816845139399

	nan
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
	1.0976928593564916
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
	1.083210010340067
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"
	1.0720632500194798

	nan
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
	1.094945769940379
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."
	1.063752088231056

	nan
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
	1.0848162668268972
making any answer, she went on as before,
	1.032343230992526

	nan
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
	1.1018195440827936
not for the entail I should not mind it."
	1.0576982975718467

	nan
"What should not you mind?"
	1.016648195941311

	nan
"I should not mind any thing at all."
	1.0469595610328148

	nan
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
	1.0703010879651105
insensibility."
	nan

	nan
"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.
	1.0957512485052705
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
	1.0796136178820992
one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.
	1.0935994242705573
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"
	1.0593975916620095

	nan
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.

CHAPTER I.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
	1.1010669012914154
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
	1.0418999671358213
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
	1.0834179251763836
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
	1.072785065293258
the country.
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
	1.0869036713786375
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
	1.0714392118350504
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
	1.0656462977517311
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
	1.0902095077251643
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
	0.0
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
	1.0760329456105622
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
	1.0753179576116882
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
	1.0962203964203785
the latter with regard to new furniture.
	1.0448140099503112

	nan
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
	1.0790871152051664
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
	1.060611415037781
for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline's
	1.0792173705237271
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
	1.0710417984374672
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
	1.0765643019697577
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
	1.0895022034467214
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
	1.0548013831068144
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
	1.0706320541262861
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
	1.0800965372646032
the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been
	1.076543102868473
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
	1.086156452674361
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
	1.0602306893268303
thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on
	1.0606392261987165
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
	1.0571611598867148
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
	1.073271106669392
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
	1.042646311387106
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
	1.07340340802574
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
	1.0614861792166006
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
	1.0152236351390231
the same, her peace equally wounded.
	1.0371763058416255

	nan
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
	1.0917525005423043
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
	1.089764345103078
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
	1.0235862373000142
not help saying,
	1.0011509172513617

	nan
"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
	1.0828057242977278
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I
	1.076902002442127
will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
	1.0870597482915438
all be as we were before."
	1.0225203593005299

	nan
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
	1.0535303198617392
nothing.
	nan

	nan
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
	1.0605913272248173
reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
	0.0
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
	1.0805643395612874
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
	1.1005546722949844
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."
	1.075723571004359

	nan
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
	1.068399743922527
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
	1.109643104544437
has done no harm to any one but myself."
	1.0510387862085544

	nan
"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your sweetness
	1.070260549106341
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
	1.0776109763467387
you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
	1.0929609465566485
deserve."
	nan

	nan
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
	1.0570210849824007
the praise on her sister's warm affection.
	1.0527868565393383

	nan
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
	1.0943969637221544
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. _I_ only
	1.0907272455401087
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be
	1.0744989395228755
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
	1.0601017567760962
privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people
	1.072204560077345
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
	1.1038154086815024
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
	1.0941902350119523
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
	1.0716749069920206
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
	1.063716846478423
or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
	1.0908563442449448
the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it
	1.1002956170335736
is unaccountable!"
	nan

	nan
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
	1.0965892596931859
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of
	0.0
situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and
	1.0546356612833498
Charlotte's prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a
	1.0829963183805955
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
	1.0412970197918503
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
	0.0
like regard and esteem for our cousin."
	1.0233813207822542

	nan
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
	1.0937302277694232
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
	1.0808541917909789
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
	1.0794210911293391
understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is
	1.0978959007607436
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
	1.0691445363257917
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
	1.1060017679115404
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her,
	1.05787034963555
though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one
	1.0705139251515547
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
	1.0331971570619096
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
	1.0406795724820526
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."
	1.02598873241347

	nan
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
	1.0741912949697887
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
	1.083755410600787
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
	1.0857324457769486
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
	1.0570303910243182
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
	1.0707642493807092
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
	1.0972485256333364
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
	1.0015666016755294
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
	1.0919560669454726
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
	1.0551437009981992
it does."
	0.9989990895686804

	nan
"And men take care that they should."
	1.0366480335947936

	nan
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
	1.0839887263841956
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."
	1.0896011585072936

	nan
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,"
	1.1013089865680044
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
	1.064342694951235
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
	1.0640881581515425
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
	1.057007370785841
will do the business."
	1.0044174743373788

	nan
"And do you impute it to either of those?"
	1.0438824127087887

	nan
"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
	1.1218066608726835
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."
	1.0741757019010802

	nan
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."
	1.0465878348676831

	nan
"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."
	1.0340216168588447

	nan
"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
	1.0799476111203539
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
	1.0860779803129972
secure it."
	1.0010512630236357

	nan
"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
	1.0834700792451248
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
	1.0319727565174837
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
	1.074740110978413
connections, and pride."
	1.0043325325098678

	nan
"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
	1.0790124583002352
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
	1.0727475234525257
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
	1.0670425281895823
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
	1.0773524268341834
they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think
	1.0518185270379778
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
	1.0483697449275862
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
	1.0521906125130789
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
	1.1010352657065294
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
	0.0
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
	1.115723797105582
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
	1.0659092882478012
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it
	1.099903169857141
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."
	1.0842450244552957

	nan
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's
	1.098560913900062
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
	1.01304759714338

	nan
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
	1.0839457736226474
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
	1.0692947946369993
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
	1.0606528328474714
with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
	1.0714600152647753
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
	1.077990168574309
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
	1.0845485484396478
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
	1.0829475453024358
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
	1.1269024636977532
comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
	0.0

	nan
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day,
	1.0963873624795646
"your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to
	1.0926401133885155
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
	1.098107801622497
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
	1.0925964028627473
her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be
	1.0925533241453371
long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at
	1.0934924028113937
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
	1.093350891983845
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."
	1.0904950169795797

	nan
"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
	1.092567221982265
all expect Jane's good fortune."
	1.0250652568244851

	nan
"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
	1.1022906282900247
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
	1.0660295623357101
make the most of it."
	1.0194270743048683

Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
	1.0856453898417289
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
	1.0719327661231717
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
	1.0776064161170529
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
	0.0
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
	1.080086946036112
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
	1.0597291696027475
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
	1.0782990900001665
had known any thing of the matter.
	1.0404438370415994

	nan
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
	1.0799272087743907
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
	1.0614048893308143
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
	1.047285616832678
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
	1.0693622142596606
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

CHAPTER II.

After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
	1.088453295106576
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
	1.067074609602148
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
	1.0730236106900088
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
	1.0571140097897807
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
	1.071572717848225
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave
	1.0994688723269137
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
	1.067600213087983
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
	1.0563168517705357
another letter of thanks.
	0.998508119821554

	nan
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
	1.0951232480295203
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
	1.06551284103936
Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
	1.0778322352105751
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
	1.0699538150741457
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
	1.0666140431230846
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
	1.0605809804068176
bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than
	1.0735122439674565
Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
	1.0779645951330563
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
	1.0706217128192608
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
	1.0526569904917202
regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.
	1.0598988547377997

	nan
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
	1.0938425779098264
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
	1.0572845909714739
done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
	1.1128110531810627
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
	1.1030439131625556
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
	1.0988952236149006
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
	1.0653106236618917
in it.
	1.0020387830015176

	nan
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.
	1.0872484488602374
Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think
	1.102065241659527
that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it
	1.107511007056409
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
	1.0870054009548649
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
	1.0982248541877624
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
	1.077086583451995
much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
	1.0508678489186036
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
	1.1072281993488429
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
	1.0937582947545899
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
	1.0740442278070335
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
	1.0548917688659825
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
	1.0734926169716186
long sleeves."
	0.997219100812975

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
	1.1057791548817337
the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
	1.0802284448012052
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
	1.0641202546831219
conversation.
	nan

	nan
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It
	1.086698505217104
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am
	1.0828435912094396
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
	1.0724429251169074
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
	1.0861205504935878
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
	1.0635396315524928
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."
	1.0529270407271747

	nan
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
	1.066281942963047
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often happen
	1.0836174872886792
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
	1.0687780118220966
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
	1.0815208153350608
love with only a few days before."
	1.0223566332748064

	nan
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
	1.0634535561503458
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
	1.0693637505630134
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
	1.0606745341640236
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
	1.0936206350561946
love?"
	nan

	nan
"I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite
	1.0700519104810056
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
	1.062696893382946
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
	1.0630005907678999
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I
	1.0783462833811397
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
	1.0671320785255645
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"
	1.0558086343076418

	nan
"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
	1.097719400460317
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
	1.0851773344815407
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
	1.0330167984182541
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
	1.0745295292301418
would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of
	1.0896226866504706
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
	1.0755628436975997
anything."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
	1.0567506492620917
of her sister's ready acquiescence.
	1.0320027300221781

	nan
"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
	1.0728517622875318
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
	1.0879849210190107
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
	1.069023602576124
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
	1.0645067471058656
unless he really comes to see her."
	1.0284170729402307

	nan
"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
	1.09305431163396
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
	1.102828261408158
part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
	1.0883842187253316
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
	1.0599177473305625
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
	1.0567555759937737
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
	1.08377288098392
never stirs without him."
	0.984927121961161

	nan
"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
	1.1163321405466065
correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling."
	1.0833067892862278

	nan
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
	1.0348833243142133

	nan
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
	1.0841596395812259
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
	1.0667621772054394
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
	1.0683134620958097
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
	1.049739897921779
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
	1.0628031860282554
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
	1.0564724682371218
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
	1.060840289345376
attractions.
	nan

	nan
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
	1.0633428163133147
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
	1.0834720520108367
hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
	1.080465660674003
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
	1.0661756600135872
seeing him.
	0.9989936969131392

	nan
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
	1.0756266197691897
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
	1.082167206142724
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
	1.0566238416799616
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
	1.0863667297360764
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
	1.069935191246536
made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
	1.0823129320135751
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
	1.061212317587487
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing
	1.0508944590098277
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
	1.068236813812438
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
	1.0861251797656548
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
	1.059980516460967
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
	1.0601254442214738
an attachment.
	1.0001317291084484

	nan
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
	1.0681602997641029
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
	1.0640487740456819
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
	1.059302720898273
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
	1.0624759530999464
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
	1.0562725312638372
the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
	1.0984616792062598
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
	1.0728192327204462
been in the way of procuring.
	1.0287426914105442

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
	1.0993432940059815
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
	1.0068636897024372
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
	1.061555538286737
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
	1.0240956271638375
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
	1.0735942620208876
delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the
	1.0735296801979748
present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
	0.0
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
	1.0682463673185263
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
	1.069514359112812
Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
	1.0826449590276188
boy.

CHAPTER III.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
	1.085378974497083
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
	1.0605951265228275
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
	0.9835910986829499

	nan
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
	1.086549391901278
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
	1.062899027266752
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
	1.0860529701864654
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
	1.0641554795930108
fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
	1.0754412416143564
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
	1.0806927620647584
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you
	1.1012761680052183
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
	1.091746053323532
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
	1.0625974670717775
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."
	1.0486976719027543

	nan
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."
	1.0442740348563435

	nan
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
	1.0707654525156245

	nan
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
	1.087801237954863
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
	1.116470348555163
can prevent it."
	0.9998589676820738

	nan
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
	1.0268191269699263

	nan
"I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with
	1.1177314062078405
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
	1.0985942232665251
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
	1.0833434143201432
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
	1.077504706860662
of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does
	1.1073069436184029
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
	1.0748997554967323
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
	1.0886561215108737
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
	1.0933388855655986
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
	1.0371270188348638
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
	1.0186968713843567
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
	1.0775750955019856
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
	1.1024681942703782
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
	1.0805004704968588
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
	1.126354122986267
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
	1.1096736410361112
I will do my best."
	1.0218179514369037

	nan
"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
	1.0784857959360488
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."
	1.0843466956091115

	nan
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
	1.0874870466472253
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
	1.0923468784339416
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
	1.1128812433694686
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
	1.0939771549060056
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
	1.061319817264671
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you
	1.0875529271058366
are satisfied."
	0.9995027406417495

	nan
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for
	1.0763403115277366
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
	1.070025252174882
being given on such a point, without being resented.
	1.0446968453831684

	nan
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
	1.0723674686458493
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
	1.098555166274718
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
	1.0847713748709042
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
	1.0845471929850656
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
	1.0618720306923808
she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,
	1.0824200624460791
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
	1.083749548223762
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
	1.066831536804939
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
	1.0227318534531267
out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,
	1.0666980367993266

	nan
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."
	1.0606735295951795

	nan
"_That_ you certainly shall."
	1.0142384350472868

	nan
"And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?"
	1.0874480696521014

	nan
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."
	1.0457848280701785

	nan
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
	1.0954679545982053
come to Hunsford."
	1.0046116832517389

	nan
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
	1.0621190642169513
visit.
	nan

	nan
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and
	1.0904751548851417
I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be
	1.1015661862881756
as welcome to me as either of them."
	1.0360879667495002

	nan
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
	1.0803243671548466
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
	1.103956813632049
subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
	1.0461272330504368
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
	0.0
should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
	1.0451481839091978
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
	1.063262587685111
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
	1.0785444063085776
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters
	1.0336461505501806
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
	1.0654399266157728
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
	1.075324713910555
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
	1.0591974196476417
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
	1.0511792040395451
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
	1.0344652239967909
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
	1.0053587343529435
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
	1.057651127031018
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
	1.0827069771961617
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
	1.0732495033461067
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
	1.0519414788028252
for her own visit there, to know the rest.
	1.0551444734093554

	nan
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
	1.0802746952840898
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
	1.0573300119457738
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
	1.0700154782779374

	nan
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
	1.069681152813249
generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
	1.0795032578682406
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
	1.0557453164857602
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
	1.077179038906839
lost.
	nan

	nan
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
	1.0819512571001608
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."
	1.0798219488254626

	nan
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
	1.0964112297400666
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
	1.0876281767117164
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
	1.0620822654533195
to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
	1.0987389796321012
I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
	1.0872957705947717
engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
	1.0839227608743254
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
	1.1145804795210703
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
	1.1066746299725383
soon see them here."
	0.9925092610562383

	nan
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her, that
	1.0721673292456833
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.
	1.083215541922967

	nan
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
	1.0835414446194853
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
	1.0718029277124956
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning
	1.077045627482737
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
	1.07685490669432
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
	1.067284701945622
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
	1.078082637121833
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
	1.0688416113292034
prove what she felt.
	1.0059936099023619

	nan
     "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
	1.0654100562953401
     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have
	1.063438328611987
     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my
	1.0655915609551947
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
	1.0486818555759756
     obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
	1.0489048908159329
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at
	1.0809567767359929
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
	1.0606508319645316
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
	1.0788172992577307
     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
	1.0567207960171718
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When
	1.1078623487200334
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
	1.0852361572664733
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
	1.0655302668917614
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
	1.0907044984550187
     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
	1.0546580481465984
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I
	1.0688819549089967
     cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as
	1.061282457674579
     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
	1.0774244876530608
     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
	1.0912115604962038
     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
	1.0538244181864074
     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and
	1.0788849033418075
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
	1.0441177082460738
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
	1.067898129211194
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
	1.0678814829493382
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,
	0.0
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
	1.0573545706181111
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my
	1.0869004180124555
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
	1.0611856439166891
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
	1.0753175833558435
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot
	1.0706871984962034
     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
	1.065062790707132
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
	1.0589331449356194
     duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful
	1.0724996496137025
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
	1.0465417470961136
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear
	1.089627584308019
     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never
	1.0646537561504057
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
	1.060450964559161
     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely
	1.0878475108488306
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
	1.0310422525612142
     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am
	1.1026331698967893
     sure you will be very comfortable there.
	1.0260426979113608

	nan
     "Your's, &c."
	1.0120159653125875

	nan
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
	1.0722799962884455
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
	1.0887104886017063
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
	1.0851070986866822
even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every
	1.077171651981484
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
	1.0715627574540683
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
	1.0676951752527322
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
	1.0837646127148812
regret what he had thrown away.
	1.0099081781485924

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
	1.0654282302981959
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
	1.0442098515690394
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
	1.0765681678998265
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
	1.0568071013490703
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
	1.0916063658279753
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
	1.0832628776620141
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
	1.073627222798006
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
	1.0665299684051621
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
	1.056582876744404
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
	1.0481591863195479
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
	1.0512610822773938
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
	1.0838113468610517
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
	1.0728497753408164
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
	1.0653025804693523
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
	0.0
sincerely wish him happy.
	0.9989107947100534

	nan
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
	1.0751573065797762
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
	1.0445623746542516
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
	1.0865301935247635
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
	0.0
and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
	1.0878012695618333
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
	1.0502026052977003
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
	1.096502682946046
her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
	1.120298237781487
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
	1.0584487294243061
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
	1.0571246593099637
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
	1.0675788036073075
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
	1.0665615327110292
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways
	1.1054607794528624
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
	1.0789142639039935
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
	1.046592087904379
plain."

CHAPTER IV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
	1.074298216985571
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
	1.0729803703480283
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
	1.0704042759535728
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
	1.0823660152597838
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
	1.0350510111145494
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
	1.0608098990852513
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
	1.0735641321661964
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was
	1.0832967516045369
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
	1.072918120999842
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
	1.0510034955755152
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
	1.0825850522714893
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
	1.1026018003949678
been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
	1.0746539191751068
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was
	1.0847893344984025
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of
	1.0790371003210706
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
	1.0637042285929539
perfect as plan could be.
	1.0026663286324748

	nan
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
	1.071787196549603
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
	1.0978589647604233
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
	1.074839446023207

	nan
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
	1.0729509616194806
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
	1.075469766243693
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
	1.0851289737860887
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
	1.0976553617241236
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
	1.067811765833226
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
	1.0721235778470646
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
	1.0445518955734816
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
	1.0702147750693538
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
	1.0826597503571955
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
	1.0658642174463984
amiable and pleasing.
	1.000029464454794

	nan
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
	1.0998846800863895
him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
	1.0555492069013903
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
	0.0
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
	1.068796099899624
as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
	1.0837145462813478
known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the
	1.0821460627248594
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
	1.049192269710377
out like his information.
	0.9980161858218096

	nan
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
	1.0918415039431162
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's
	1.1136917635749766
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
	1.0626394430952617
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
	1.0507704136212093
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
	1.0565507652243273
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
	1.0918769425827526
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
	1.0353057377744053
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
	1.0463721341401198
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
	1.0668105257025973
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
	1.0596860119314604
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
	1.0621541573316449

	nan
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her
	1.0881234877523052
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
	1.0667893725637672
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
	1.0532778935350666
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to
	1.065174097456177
hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
	1.0619613226832256
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and
	1.0505158034517947
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
	1.0456534679925122
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
	1.0665328760325261
acquaintance.
	nan

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
	1.072394384357191
complimented her on bearing it so well.
	1.0111444455484668

	nan
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I
	1.088847171274535
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."
	1.0396232689982186

	nan
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
	1.06406186767544
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,

and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
	1.071502618551794
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
	1.0647724460609007
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
	1.0736221607072922
mercenary."

"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."

"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
	1.071087821457143
death made her mistress of this fortune."

"No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
	1.0805159436495766
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
	1.0502572872329228
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
	1.0814317539328622
poor?"

"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant

"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. _He_ shall be

mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."

"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
	1.1056784124367678
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."
	1.097268297382452

"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
	1.1171722306207077
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
	1.0625299954308114
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
	1.092569219612957
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
	1.0667148813718246
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
	1.0795968509134757
worth knowing, after all."
	0.9968379321763067

"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."
	1.0572094031135184

	nan
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
	1.0823506779149803
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
	1.0510675782846477
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
	1.059207842686844

	nan
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.
	1.0793407599844198
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."
	1.0354139685874666

	nan
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
	1.0633813276576598
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "My dear, dear
	1.06828958721456
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me
	1.0453946193769081
fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men
	1.056502930075335
to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And
	1.0828029762501885
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
	1.051752466203479
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We _will_ know where
	1.0911540273235687
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,
	1.0615850648211038
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
	1.0702151057003615
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
	1.0473392868717277
about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less
	1.0520610369830303
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."

CHAPTER V.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
	1.086633877036058
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
	1.078331700337114
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
	1.0618192315196366
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
	1.0915983528154967

	nan
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
	1.099509259383485
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
	1.0853202772481112
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
	1.0783075360600751
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
	1.0744882994215554

	nan
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,
	1.0871010775922973
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
	1.089181167162286
thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at
	1.059147799046697
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
	1.1001734338351596
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
	1.071538985560572
party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
	1.0903429991361953
sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
	0.0
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
	1.0557147091867867
she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her
	1.0680541963665109
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
	1.0603785700846375
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
	1.0837248001450295
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then,
	1.0857583341360952
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
	1.0782722140476135
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
	1.046628566192686
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
	1.051704857746246
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.
	1.0540780826763185

	nan
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
	1.0869131818190298
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
	1.0729810949640208
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
	1.056253567282088
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though
	1.088791134227103
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
	1.0724280042260832
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
	1.0796850663691562
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr.
	1.105132468597487
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
	1.0675642825233738
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
	1.052048483427705
Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
	1.0892288035302387
Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every
	1.0728467034552207
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
	1.0829923836941688
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
	1.0747938427660653
Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
	1.1036258607293015
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.
	1.0914064731129567
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
	1.0778976442347017
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
	1.0574520568258863
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
	1.0794600248151867
much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
	1.064974925677623
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
	1.0488788196925578
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
	1.0619905959109703
beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction,
	1.0482175885500127
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But
	1.095378728001762
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
	1.0880951021853105
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
	1.0600919447859138
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
	1.0591971844052257
opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well
	1.0791942882235068
situated on rising ground.
	1.0036818698033645

	nan
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
	1.0869787323828324
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
	1.0868649505696317
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
	1.0551052928973528
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
	1.0570693791651207
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
	1.0524405182986332
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
	1.070258769759936
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
	1.0520500706415765
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
	1.0920081475077248
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
	1.0494340230105303
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
	1.0660968065007428
forgotten.
	nan

	nan
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
	1.0892909329742386
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
	1.075448098269186
in, observed,
	nan

	nan
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
	1.0744844184418805
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
	1.0979986244316082
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
	1.0741905194063186
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
	1.0697358138326094
service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
	1.0834543985620444
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
	1.0518870585732538
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
	1.0455366515768272
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
	1.0756451879341336
walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
	1.0661288324579523
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."
	1.0653187617290745

	nan
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
	1.0628817100039307
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."
	1.0339509772491073

	nan
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
	1.1059853641844062
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."
	1.0332310217056777

	nan
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
	1.061339575762605
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
	1.0199788818569637
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
	1.0676336066491583
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
	1.0654269928042441
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
	1.0707736238312542
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would
	1.096926236133226
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
	1.056574853787279
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
	1.077321644598854
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
	1.0572265894528996

	nan
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
	1.1054806171811609
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
	1.08800575760363
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
	1.0457731472432665
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the
	1.0813102186904928
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
	1.055799502691977
agitation, cried out,
	1.0006527474176548

	nan
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
	1.0906880268142911
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
	1.1112073560890952
haste, and come down this moment."
	1.0195013215117714

	nan
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
	1.0647009033741943
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
	1.0840807109895367
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
	1.0861088966480252
garden gate.
	1.0017798634348258

	nan
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs
	1.0927506425798375
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
	1.0795373478586752
daughter!"
	nan

	nan
"La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady
	1.0869683006024227
Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The
	1.1028810599701195
other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
	1.106407346016368
creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"
	1.0655579942158941

	nan
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
	1.0990019800374322
Why does she not come in?"
	1.0230680630866842

	nan
"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
	1.0927310720302033
when Miss De Bourgh comes in."
	1.0275989962209937

	nan
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She
	1.0714561196308237
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
	1.0945800256593778
make him a very proper wife."
	1.0192980731611718

	nan
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
	1.0767036747032028
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high
	1.059755421253244
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
	1.0457056589714775
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh
	0.9922998840252044
looked that way.
	1.0039542675121382

	nan
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
	1.0900394503638353
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
	1.1064229671056949
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
	1.0266432930747402
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
	1.073208786367207
to dine at Rosings the next day.

CHAPTER VI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.
	1.0827636149690143
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
	1.0766064247031923
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
	1.0578921710634115
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
	1.0512895354910192
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
	0.0
Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.
	1.0658488974415805

	nan
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
	1.0820604722421636
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
	1.0981348338862413
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
	1.08159748999615
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
	1.0712168477759152
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
	1.058931545849346
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
	1.0455753321692534
your arrival!"
	nan

	nan
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
	1.0739130223411217
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
	1.0808926529106258
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such
	1.0878678807754132
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."
	1.031522524276785

	nan
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
	1.0822525929144464
their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in
	1.0754922421306552
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
	1.0659121662216666
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.
	1.0480369972548602

	nan
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,
	1.0808014967196709

	nan
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
	1.074864504002034
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
	1.0713511052204527
becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
	1.0604234802470496
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
	1.0822279906310173
for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
	1.0970320696134326
being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
	1.0734350432088628
preserved."
	nan

	nan
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
	1.0731440305519622
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
	1.0498611417213728
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of
	1.077259133760692
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
	1.0587025051860246
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
	1.0672282009062521
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
	1.0575143660294628
done to his presentation at St. James's.
	1.0567455159193868

	nan
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
	1.0967060598633014
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
	1.0303414359811285
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
	1.0851904899643647
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
	1.071253031196857
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
	1.0520075548991812
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
	1.0571026508338366
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.
	1.0133366798824361

	nan
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
	1.088184048119198
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
	1.0410632432083198
calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of
	1.07555779618824
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
	1.0678710191464027
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
	0.0
thought she could witness without trepidation.
	1.0096624279315596

	nan
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
	1.0871542624518626
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
	1.0382361992672537
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,
	1.0805697793860738
her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great
	1.0793629461675918
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it
	1.0637480082913107
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
	1.0917348280751265
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
	1.0470469644956089
which he would have thought necessary.
	1.0224021922914834

	nan
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely
	1.1006261123445957
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
	1.034050075157044
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
	1.0891010716287475
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
	1.0765461288534344
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
	1.0784002870758864
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
	1.0731122806515818
composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
	1.044792565065328
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air
	1.0297362632578881
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
	1.0707658385994454
make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered
	1.0585671182871832
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
	1.0426598645243235
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.
	1.0521667783710928
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
	1.0814315509505699
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
	1.055199397127038
represented.
	nan

	nan
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
	1.0584250508785904
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
	1.0955643122037915
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her
	1.0617584531323379
being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any
	1.0864040971088613
likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
	1.076556925926322
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
	1.0277360766641181
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
	1.0756235544020838
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
	1.0518963939960848
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
	1.0835548115381233
her eyes.
	1.001863189880847

	nan
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
	1.0859825289004374
to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its
	1.0871474472062148
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
	1.051074371791247
better worth looking at in the summer.
	1.0237669895589538

	nan
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
	1.0576317525610521
and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he
	1.103004043032153
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
	1.0882251603744328
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
	1.0762998675323527
nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
	1.0318251817786905
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
	1.0690177206024116
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
	1.0796091776452597
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
	1.0604251412432804
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
	1.0581757938851897
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
	1.0459257351798397
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
	1.0838330676326489
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
	1.0644715490411787
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
	1.0805919865389226
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
	1.0621747231147756
dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
	1.055708746567191
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
	1.088299747189878
were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
	1.0689162820683302
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
	1.024500232664141

	nan
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
	1.0933459265942347
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
	1.067886915745502
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
	0.0
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
	1.062952526569931
her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
	1.0570772707209979
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
	1.0649133070428876
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
	1.0954412527152741
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
	1.094831622473424
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
	1.0773310437708439
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
	1.0503281759119627
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with
	1.078867270181055
Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
	1.0777240381621953
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
	1.07038654608296
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,
	1.0965662068862811
pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters
	1.068887278025611
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
	1.064994994503613
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
	1.051271557521284
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
	1.0717294879407901
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
	1.0615056084548697
questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then
	1.0456136382162258
observed,
	nan

	nan
"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
	1.1052818549554133
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
	1.0288430276322005
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought
	1.0789235832170128
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss
	1.0755428534113765
Bennet?"
	nan

	nan
"A little."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
	1.0858433352421484
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
	1.0436947662352494
some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"
	1.0330290627155052

	nan
"One of them does."
	1.0177053584144329

	nan
"Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned. The Miss
	1.0917128948951842
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
	1.0701700451543508
your's.--Do you draw?"
	1.026039828334234

	nan
"No, not at all."
	1.0166062637925444

	nan
"What, none of you?"
	1.0099856101356746

	nan
"Not one."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
	1.1046091541163574
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."
	1.0748231492860214

	nan
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."
	1.0751033719963712

	nan
"Has your governess left you?"
	1.0185800533924918

	nan
"We never had any governess."
	1.023485111031342

	nan
"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
	1.066001774502784
without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
	1.0871333516829311
have been quite a slave to your education."
	1.0353780303950295

	nan
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
	1.0683399695433284
been the case.
	1.0076680108638194

	nan
"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must
	1.0723322223757936
have been neglected."
	0.9994796424485566

	nan
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
	1.0827890324235478
wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
	1.0833186551869043
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
	1.082758265824432
idle, certainly might."
	0.9790883048251522

	nan
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
	1.0972020214594636
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
	1.0574941311842414
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
	1.090922075417895
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
	1.0851539766618319
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
	1.0638823403323348
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
	1.1033760777735697
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
	1.0686849604035922
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
	1.0756820142480266
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
	1.0595466490587964
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's
	1.0867147400749866
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady
	1.0462201702735878
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
	1.0827542532419143
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"
	1.0044539527096188

	nan
"Yes, Ma'am, all."
	1.0176742753761037

	nan
"All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the
	1.078193643192363
second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
	1.0660129203487774
younger sisters must be very young?"
	1.0111150948844072

	nan
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
	1.0999647496507523
in company. But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
	1.0933430870233258
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
	1.0524068450177577
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
	1.0662322768289267
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
	1.090934512201048
youth, as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
	1.109604616266926
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
	1.0652663386451633
mind."
	nan

	nan
"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very
	1.0595528001299894
decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"
	1.0690003868110771

	nan
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
	1.0505749387351158
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."
	1.0440606778789243

	nan
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
	1.060515612450645
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
	1.0749460273640818
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
	1.0476380023213496

	nan
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
	1.0709966905821477
conceal your age."
	1.0062834780569714

	nan
"I am not one and twenty."
	1.0288052555743186

	nan
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
	1.0826335806013574
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
	1.0978904574516586
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
	1.0627971674877694
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
	1.092684666752098
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
	1.0630354973690854
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
	1.0794627571425672
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
	1.0705883849956863
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
	1.064924896234521
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
	1.0548823340691278
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
	1.0921631414360542
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
	1.0709846623381505
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
	1.0806572434284611
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
	1.0883454701662725
and noble names.
	1.0092561029802838

	nan
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
	1.076910063896262
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
	1.0851731844268122
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
	1.0493579009213336
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
	1.060214597470604
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the
	1.0933668482981649
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
	1.0732624458987812
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As
	1.0969714719097912
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
	1.0626951709226506
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
	1.079903176828926
for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But
	1.0800140190369418
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
	1.0578073069942195
satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's
	1.0842949598416383
praise into his own hands.

CHAPTER VII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough
	1.0893367212498932
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
	1.080247599197364
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
	1.086691564847523
with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings
	1.093135918847406
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
	1.0996307849968907
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
	1.0057998912388468
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
	1.0810503045643518
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
	1.0838583294878494
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
	1.071224185818128
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
	1.076240148426908
fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
	1.0767148708707444
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
	1.062007583887953
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
	1.096313588223171
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
	1.0360886409744865
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
	0.0
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
	1.0525369986037816
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
	1.039198308516536

	nan
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
	1.0755246307987958
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
	1.0795501363386386
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
	1.0749410321782804
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
	1.0582963744817748
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
	1.0749180741781643
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
	1.0548389896952526
prevailed on to get out.
	1.0064867783926499

	nan
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
	1.091610304645483
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
	1.0809457308752592
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
	1.0605062333603732
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
	1.0804966475025826
hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
	1.0711353428652282
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
	1.0673940058928197
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
	1.0520341122621635
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
	1.0666919222544178
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
	1.0799766967565976
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
	1.036125386017691
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.
	1.0938754317189596

	nan
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
	1.0654064341781417
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
	1.0795303472602107
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
	1.0836330700207426
Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
	1.0882459295080849
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
	1.0573583679817875
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
	1.051510197824812
them into harmony and plenty.
	1.009372055211485

	nan
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
	1.068318952033713
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card
	1.0930573556963683
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
	1.0376743407233582
the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
	1.0941230112253437
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach. This
	1.0671192132534626
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
	1.0746394252364284
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
	1.0209991758352004
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
	1.0956493873433815
had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where
	1.0758983461275033
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
	1.0715611742467053
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
	1.082333450446619
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
	1.074110187940706
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.
	1.054663391871038

	nan
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
	1.0902572771135197
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
	1.0747659520254327
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
	1.085732218477933
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy
	1.0573030537458044
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
	1.0838821557334328
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
	1.074506687754555
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
	1.0443697615866727
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
	1.0839959206298948
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
	1.071110505984474
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
	1.0638105263483906
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
	1.062206800385464
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
	1.0605368763554155
Miss Lucas and herself.
	1.0197674123057752

	nan
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking
	1.094038814711434
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
	1.0755706083608216
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
	1.0891560007680696
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
	1.0766360046954888
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
	1.0714139076935332
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
	1.079352285940908
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
	1.0946137595180276
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
	1.079867768551509
Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
	1.0808542816533862
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
	1.0656688303627497
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,
	1.0534587604041499

	nan
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
	1.0923290644625305
never have come so soon to wait upon me."
	1.0082624557727444

	nan
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
	1.0605745737363
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
	1.0463643033167962
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
	1.0527426630128762
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
	1.0652493996444767
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
	1.0785117995482998
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
	1.038677994873256
reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
	1.0698146260056467
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
	1.0479792024663366
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.
	1.040664329201789

	nan
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
	1.0415349716566153
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
	0.0
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
	1.0658509153345068
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.
	1.0992757915548335
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
	1.0768369806599771
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
	1.0909492513263668
way, and after a moment's pause, added,
	1.030672786014433

	nan
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
	1.0888258971188065
happened to see her there?"
	1.004451533352092

	nan
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
	1.0723929885482066
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
	0.0
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
	1.0806069814468562
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
	1.082241304700779
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
	1.0423629296503982
away.

CHAPTER VIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
	1.066245911344472
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
	1.0930427730482073
their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
	1.0658031060214115
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
	1.0237899555476846
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
	1.055237520904376
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
	1.0689023755985456
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
	1.070012424784892
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
	1.0937548241774717
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
	1.0716888074102622
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had
	1.098785645976547
only seen at church.
	1.0046388286334058

	nan
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
	1.075169724021707
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them
	1.0925898321434095
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
	1.0559369050332743
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
	1.0669294094643702
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
	1.0439869190994735
much more than to any other person in the room.
	1.0464278222880414

	nan
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
	1.0749083367664818
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had
	1.0620942780681673
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
	1.0702786642877458
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
	1.0556975768340806
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
	1.0805797822333718
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
	1.061005428528461
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
	1.0686628416046702
well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
	1.0951164995071694
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
	1.0607813720741792
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
	1.0508772709840473
scruple to call out,
	0.9838758618845364

	nan
"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
	1.0769143800730197
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."
	1.080972463960363

	nan
"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
	1.0859508357190035
a reply.
	1.0045015887674622

	nan
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
	1.1086746307879145
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
	1.075874646156282
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
	1.0789801691675263
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I
	1.1001695225789214
should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
	1.0817882953741504
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
	1.0870181429034147
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"
	1.0335841314681227

	nan
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.
	1.0869686272998471

	nan
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
	1.0883286528332254
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
	1.073775614176052
if she does not practise a great deal."
	1.0440463228487857

	nan
"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.
	1.08222360498793
She practises very constantly."
	1.0145568944789736

	nan
"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
	1.1069645579175642
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
	1.1068084188441878
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
	1.0488767483647046
without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
	1.0589657054924002
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
	1.0610911775428378
Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often
	1.0938950196566197
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
	1.0875001212922288
Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
	1.1168447612000307
part of the house."
	1.0121305556153337

	nan
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
	1.1020437919495958
no answer.
	1.0027982992310502

	nan
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
	1.055738696828376
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
	1.0898793815315835
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
	1.093805941825653
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
	1.0660269979563681
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
	1.059060163359462
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
	1.0647948872337523
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
	1.0511490429854518
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,
	1.0140725178526244

	nan
"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
	1.1083993772705407
me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.
	1.0716850123959283
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
	1.0886886511530707
the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to
	1.0827464994188454
intimidate me."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
	1.0686154676044832
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
	1.070821324699143
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
	1.0741637852502166
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
	1.01629464986116
are not your own."
	1.011513123944729

	nan
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
	1.0584585191863907
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
	1.0704752221396219
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
	1.0821454104818946
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
	1.091361499105614
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
	1.0954587121020456
of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
	1.0971090016792417
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
	1.0663559487626695
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
	1.0662641363246645
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."
	1.0840105302194805

	nan
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.
	1.047887964914676

	nan
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
	1.066468273359875
Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
	1.0784244541015893

	nan
"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
	1.062752423979429
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
	1.0735432869627763
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
	1.0938494811539665
only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was. He danced only
	1.0937442934342423
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
	1.0403884550621376
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr.
	1.092638486462063
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."
	1.029763287238771

	nan
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
	1.0957845399511958
beyond my own party."
	0.0

	nan
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel
	1.0867775884644326
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."
	1.0689449650124758

	nan
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
	1.0720395371932618
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."
	1.0692569262318425

	nan
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still
	1.074682414790366
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
	1.073956984904189
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
	1.0667601922262933
himself to strangers?"
	0.9892776545364621

	nan
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
	1.0542344196782185
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."
	1.0651968419218056

	nan
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
	1.0703028020199585
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
	1.0805768508670497
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
	1.038296964062871
concerns, as I often see done."
	1.0261481674306514

	nan
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
	1.0658576919357097
masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same
	1.0967786219875053
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
	0.0
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
	1.0626385921550692
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
	1.0780431321245736
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."
	1.0408692719208394

	nan
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your
	1.0775877658358182
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
	1.0744291292830652
think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."
	1.0729949236182044

	nan
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
	1.066365206167289
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
	1.055772666555434
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
	1.062384629831157
to Darcy,
	nan

	nan
"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
	1.0798887193757345
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
	1.0988098348012272
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have
	1.1002314865201566
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."
	1.061882313580339

	nan
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
	1.067963843865279
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
	1.0684072477894686
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
	1.0632929113726515
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
	1.0783093611902868
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
	1.0658636352563835

	nan
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
	1.0602711076332407
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
	1.0599386443174506
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
	1.0772624130370931
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was
	1.0473192478253517
ready to take them all home.

CHAPTER IX.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
	1.0753625544150318
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
	1.0772790344953664
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
	1.0951004859686673
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
	1.0727952906999767
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
	1.0553870216371233
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
	1.0454141588590147
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr.
	1.102880925910348
Darcy only, entered the room.
	1.0271211455514673

	nan
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
	1.070021080424001
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
	0.0
be within.
	0.9989171881247588

	nan
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
	1.0626088345731692
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
	1.0682314878820196
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
	1.0335663751706514
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
	1.0302591185117072
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
	1.0721873858791002
departure, she observed,
	0.9952205002429761

	nan
"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
	1.0721312819805418
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
	1.100252515633303
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
	1.0791004114318938
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."
	1.0801296635516249

	nan
"Perfectly so--I thank you."
	1.0274095313223424

	nan
She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
	1.0895771284464413
pause, added,
	nan

	nan
"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
	1.0974814603765988
returning to Netherfield again?"
	1.0018999351737807

	nan
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
	1.0829521545892493
very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is
	1.1081288486109673
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
	1.0573229808833777
increasing."
	nan

	nan
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
	1.089887095576048
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
	1.0505390783491113
might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did
	1.0610998285305138
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
	1.0838273824568154
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
	1.099447362092518
principle."
	nan

	nan
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
	1.0929817169583873
soon as any eligible purchase offers."
	1.0120656596282553

	nan
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
	1.0844081752661787
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
	1.0660223023472437
trouble of finding a subject to him.
	1.0207571401127777

	nan
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
	1.0819124719192634
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
	1.0899153820539864
Collins first came to Hunsford."
	1.025482325577528

	nan
"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
	1.0807759703851925
kindness on a more grateful object."
	1.0123241259614704

	nan
"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."
	1.0808560623875807

	nan
"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
	1.0884507459233739
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
	1.0764529328806962
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
	1.0491014807081303
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest
	1.0915757192781004
thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
	1.0559004669475367
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."
	1.0703406333052101

	nan
"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
	1.0881800069604617
distance of her own family and friends."
	1.0377659437201898

	nan
"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."
	1.07685649739933

	nan
"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's
	1.0930183164692915
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."
	1.0603249300250297

	nan
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
	1.072159852304041
of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins
	1.0941964869308378
was settled _near_ her family."
	1.0182037933673833

	nan
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond
	1.095652782799374
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."
	1.0741047263363221

	nan
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
	1.0766101934190069
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
	1.0306360431569135
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,
	1.0338747655481433

	nan
"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
	1.1004196698602016
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
	1.0900402634883637
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of
	1.0653554080731824
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
	1.061161415224766
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
	0.0
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
	1.088265591794226
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
	1.0486302769820235
the present distance."
	1.0115686673751116

	nan
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
	1.0923387977791117
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
	1.0766663474355664
been always at Longbourn."
	0.9939815642914475

	nan
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
	1.0565446466879211
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
	1.0620005231968035
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,
	0.9714471931312897

	nan
"Are you pleased with Kent?"
	1.014425445292872

	nan
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
	1.0873489819207145
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
	1.073453038954393
and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised
	1.0836620246783533
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
	1.0732328221207394
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
	1.0729547404391595
much to any body, went away.
	1.0227447128495537

	nan
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
	1.0854921728878975
gone. "My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
	1.0799399822735798
called on us in this familiar way."
	1.0085557929369857

	nan
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
	1.0784584676090931
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
	1.0698370421002366
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
	1.024520706897947
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
	1.0841089897486655
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
	1.0988354920566783
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
	1.0722720143631757
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
	0.0
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
	1.0931168803347102
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
	1.0617549000504103
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
	1.0705981660978388
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
	1.05693495587373
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
	1.0756793967958629
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
	1.058203293618977
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
	1.0503874636497414
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
	1.0756866282146298
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
	1.0639564345092456
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
	1.0498158487927043
she believed he might have the best informed mind.
	1.0500872973788355

	nan
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
	1.1019315586359206
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
	1.0830595951722142
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
	1.0708473636944265
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
	1.0617389036895668
propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
	1.051723708898699
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
	1.0906600732606921
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
	1.0632660881142169
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
	1.0503859838566856
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
	1.0875363306868906
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
	1.0665766057635861
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
	1.081636843037856
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
	1.0782826811218251
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
	1.0745302371713357
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
	1.057663131099138
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
	1.0377436125924384
seemed nothing but absence of mind.
	1.015777561568815

	nan
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
	1.0723890978106567
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
	1.0779727187840076
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
	1.0960010913296157
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
	1.0328464566210895
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
	1.0624484224539037
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
	1.0709698734374695

	nan
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
	1.064192931437928
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
	1.0705446408272008
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
	1.0616261940889606
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
	1.0613462074204523
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

CHAPTER X.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly
	1.069618318701636
meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
	1.092019557495563
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
	1.070770314207826
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
	1.07194192165931
favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was
	1.0856036949302592
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful
	1.0919510701657968
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
	1.0588279315729712
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
	1.0704689430439804
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never
	1.063272607781454
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
	1.0831962710972005
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
	1.0291558091772155
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
	1.0714857010985706
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.
	1.0779164567620647
and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
	1.0942021622167983
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
	1.059963260143427
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words
	1.0800113292531237
seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
	1.0724115837859496
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
	1.081435266336127
might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was
	1.039961424434849
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
	1.0680414953416202
Parsonage.
	nan

	nan
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
	1.084170476237627
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
	1.0518292229166115
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,
	1.063798434887042
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting
	1.078440027484122
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,
	1.0414052076999012

	nan
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."
	1.0591437923126623

	nan
"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally
	1.0946812279837395
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
	1.0972823825594415
you going much farther?"
	0.9986020519620082

	nan
"No, I should have turned in a moment."
	1.0472028617255584

	nan
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
	1.0558911171941354
together.
	nan

	nan
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.
	1.0548899513500112

	nan
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
	1.1143815442382283
arranges the business just as he pleases."
	1.0405529740862662

	nan
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
	1.0870425201211025
great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems
	1.0847997538681027
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."
	1.0898813244307146

	nan
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
	1.081377678397241
"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than
	1.119180058652568
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
	1.0744881918329836
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
	1.086995643925696
dependence."
	nan

	nan
"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of
	1.089321388529707
either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
	1.0591352163901986
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
	1.0543544822417188
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"
	1.039793703511146

	nan
"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
	1.0688272108788728
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
	1.0646422227465575
weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry
	1.079758735584355
where they like."
	0.9867720677372511

	nan
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
	1.0697250232461133
do."
	nan

	nan
"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
	1.0796885452254072
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
	1.070871753248438
money."
	nan

	nan
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the
	1.0726136031542357
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is
	1.0457900297124239
the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is
	1.0949001671393197
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."
	1.076726398994408

	nan
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
	1.096824852364115
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
	1.0738239970287022
she soon afterwards said,
	1.0080569098913486

	nan
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
	1.0847461615381604
having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
	0.0
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well
	1.068533367632465
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
	1.1008152917910012
likes with her."
	1.00019384589785

	nan
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
	1.0646454476425582
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."
	1.1025347798546652

	nan
"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
	1.0803253907817998
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
	1.0555613203013665
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
	1.0802106153681985
may like to have her own way."
	1.0179227375153588

	nan
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
	1.0767752430141635
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
	1.0710954943620647
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
	1.0576504103376632
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,
	1.0252285350430745

	nan
"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
	1.1041764775985696
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
	0.0
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
	1.0832358632420365
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."
	1.0930585343068413

	nan
"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
	1.0855233709502337
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."
	1.0458352132217077

	nan
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
	1.091219425280018
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."

"Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
	1.0882890159248617
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
	1.064264979570032
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
	1.0545215243606563
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
	1.107371250873077
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."
	1.0712642860418287

	nan
"What is it you mean?"
	1.0199433198421126

	nan
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
	1.077518200289882
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
	1.0755972435627046
it would be an unpleasant thing."
	1.0238607202216403

	nan
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
	1.0428544400611632

	nan
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
	1.0754551423016936
Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
	1.0732451172106827
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
	1.0688420440580664
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
	1.0006975329201508
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
	1.0564346675723069
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
	1.104171267100927
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."
	1.0616998914661917

	nan
"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"
	1.0655215192467842

	nan
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
	1.062752578527044
lady."
	nan

	nan
"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
	1.0402572780282053

	nan
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling. "He
	1.093035961078852
only told me, what I have now told you."
	1.0392896609696138

	nan
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
	1.0642745588942004
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
	1.060728171924515
was so thoughtful.
	1.0077771412603194

	nan
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your
	1.0796261524711332
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"
	1.0852604725047044

	nan
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"
	1.0432077112859954

	nan
"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
	1.1047303171399112
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
	1.0781446771548382
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But,"
	1.0726149440031378
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
	1.046488863070532
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
	1.077745071678987
that there was much affection in the case."
	1.0501461016521931

	nan
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
	1.0645002215418384
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."
	1.0661725943142166

	nan
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
	1.0855231388213624
Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
	1.0808527107725487
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
	1.0203372313687697
matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
	1.0602544480627378
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
	1.055287238504018
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
	1.1008236923357713
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
	1.057573952618038
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have
	1.0959046959533214
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
	1.069853704571879
taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
	1.0719522822202794
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
	1.05039298283041
arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
	1.0553235869047777
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
	1.0913266194994975
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a
	1.0888290215418535
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
	1.0554384299422637
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
	1.0881767630965413
inflicted.
	nan

	nan
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
	1.0700280114879064
Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
	1.057342513522067
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
	1.0541470069789025
business in London.
	0.992527750894345

	nan
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
	1.0631335973932508
objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding
	1.0548400893103853
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could
	1.0366887968321876
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
	1.0492174645255525
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,
	1.0622425967095315
and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought
	1.0647983727818595
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
	1.078272855458501
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.
	1.0647586117611303
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
	1.070650667402621
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
	1.0843277120809516
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
	1.0789610537024898
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
	1.0638849813721933
retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.
	1.0335450807804525

	nan
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
	1.06381975455285
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
	1.0807063392014713
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
	1.0839976374514229
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
	1.0779931368115727
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
	1.088358520380018
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins
	1.0606407894217926
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
	1.0572194629491907
displeased by her staying at home.

CHAPTER XI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
	1.068591976887095
much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
	1.0520084690568006
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
	1.070846425522676
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
	1.0725308394088346
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
	1.0626411813678982
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
	1.1077034084516626
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
	0.0
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
	1.0481245226579732
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
	1.0397753102984189
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
	1.0473069134981816
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
	0.0
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
	1.05280604587914
keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to
	1.0810374385891839
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
	1.095557831769408
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
	1.0894858970381915
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
	1.0794005388863144
spirits, by all that affection could do.
	1.0333590089091718

	nan
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that
	1.0726871477931161
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
	1.082516855239611
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
	1.0873892219109702
mean to be unhappy about him.
	1.002479376223639

	nan
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
	1.0829463867588898
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
	1.0723436536379263
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
	1.0506179416196744
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But
	1.0817443462572052
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
	1.0501775868575058
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
	1.0809267154666624
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
	1.0646267876276594
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
	1.0765106236778876
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
	1.0917945420135715
then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said
	0.0
not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
	1.0999572387687455
agitated manner, and thus began,
	1.0042199809072003

	nan
"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
	1.1041844978571278
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
	0.0
you."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
	1.0565207561723193
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,
	1.0477402273594136
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
	1.0836463052699632
immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides
	1.0506816102607093
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
	1.0797061005440973
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
	1.05935882475719
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
	1.0602295635175016
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
	0.0
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
	0.0
recommend his suit.
	0.9747357936078351

	nan
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
	1.077912721196835
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
	1.086060379497639
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
	1.1014805254151416
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
	1.0286300677721245
all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
	1.0630074052497656
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
	1.0608058148229005
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
	1.0404521480471398
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
	1.051812090447963
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
	1.0537011162833407
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
	1.0987305552097102
a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
	1.0689132658886564
countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only
	1.0208140116669937
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
	1.0445056493287597
cheeks, and she said,
	1.0021429984203

	nan
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
	1.0829635244941906
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
	1.0365414662142818
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be
	1.0706571240941802
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
	0.0
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
	1.0484884340516711
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
	1.0494071926156645
one. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
	1.0899833566513557
short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
	1.0501654490392884
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
	1.034452531603834
it after this explanation."
	1.008545576165911

	nan
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
	1.0942027502206113
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
	1.080356172664458
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
	1.0500806266380738
his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
	1.0756693389195109
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
	1.0558818304088549
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
	1.065652677779399
dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,
	1.0717232956399698

	nan
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
	1.1124975598748341
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
	1.0339328933515444
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."
	1.0692967438170582

	nan
"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
	1.0828630515188524
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
	1.0519315128132354
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
	1.0476696518090693
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
	1.0897437591337813
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided
	1.0842963826853467
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
	1.0405815913356486
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
	1.0482582337080182
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
	1.088459218121565
happiness of a most beloved sister?"
	1.0118066554532839

	nan
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
	1.0794535393405982
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
	1.061145796106583
continued.
	nan

	nan
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
	1.1075361136975328
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
	1.0534594845701064
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
	1.072079847472153
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
	1.0884495753341379
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
	1.062440653400996
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
	1.0321007486493121
kind."
	nan

	nan
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
	1.0695017677016683
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
	1.076252431538109
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
	1.0707512048343892

	nan
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.
	1.0548337302336077

	nan
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
	1.0692952556093338
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
	1.0919814738286682
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
	1.076677789327573
kinder than towards myself."
	1.001355998758976

	nan
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
	1.0538694755577174
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
	1.0728472456680112

	nan
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
	1.0773108702799645
is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
	1.0791495396596775
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
	1.0654068326918198
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
	1.0982230562474453
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
	0.0
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"
	1.0420756681344445

	nan
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in
	1.0773223560380367
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
	1.0527832615095036

	nan
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
	1.0700544591615277
interest in him?"
	0.9934871509249875

	nan
"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
	1.0405901523031578
have been great indeed."
	1.0021579474840996

	nan
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced
	1.077187918132711
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have
	1.0560049732070547
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
	1.062316879763342
him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
	1.0796640390744392
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and
	1.097805313371088
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
	1.063627016093759
ridicule."
	nan

	nan
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
	1.0737126481309063
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
	1.0949154607484055
thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
	1.0556122205037097
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his
	1.057741129949174
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
	1.0279338072769817
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
	1.063952168812983
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
	1.0504941667400784
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy
	1.0427675144204671
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
	0.0
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
	1.0444682256135507
reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
	1.069397343481442
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.
	1.1109803185358467
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
	1.0695549505910944
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
	1.0746718721286972
is so decidedly beneath my own?"
	1.0236956103975943

	nan
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
	1.0674125225806084
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,
	1.052128390464013

	nan
"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
	1.089834707842894
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
	1.0519802404018632
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
	1.0658142118261194
more gentleman-like manner."
	1.003050953186536

	nan
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,
	1.074796532400069

	nan
"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
	1.0942251765450903
that would have tempted me to accept it."
	1.043136304829621

	nan
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
	1.0657451972318452
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.
	1.05425048620607

	nan
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my
	1.0979993553326033
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
	1.0494079281464865
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
	1.0564954501863302
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
	1.0503329803240646
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
	0.0
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
	1.0876701734480883
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."
	1.082156110361615

	nan
"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
	1.0567010277048376
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
	1.0756311341327383
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
	1.087749195047127
wishes for your health and happiness."
	0.9693128442273431

	nan
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
	1.0845430006152428
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
	1.0812630755207924

	nan
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to
	1.0933804321201424
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
	1.0273566948576496
hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
	1.0588016427024982
increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
	1.0668612394527686
marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for
	0.0
so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
	1.1097547111400599
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
	1.0708875915566203
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
	1.0742072856642182
was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
	1.049547274488943
so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his
	1.0714839355197954
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his
	1.0637672513416472
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
	1.028090890509344
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his
	1.0781396099004916
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
	1.0472923609543972
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.
	0.0

	nan
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
	1.0695714794627476
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
	1.0690424133264533
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.

CHAPTER XII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
	1.0777646263074505
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
	1.084019479948043
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
	1.0525115426379144
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
	1.0394603212931797
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
	1.0602618808764477
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
	1.063537529523948
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
	1.0542684974178664
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.
	1.0889598802471132
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
	1.0900572473448278
one of the gates into the ground.
	1.042115519489377

	nan
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
	1.0867993514499643
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
	0.0
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had
	1.0499210527188536
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
	1.0737350426203327
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
	1.1090733682987721
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
	1.0830176438730905
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.
	0.0
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now
	1.0837504337813202
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
	1.0540575819359899
her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
	1.0756451413591048
a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
	1.0902958370577214
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
	1.0822830939687529
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
	1.0680298298446964
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
	1.088553602817153
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a
	1.0853031992447628
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
	1.0558245921620761
sight.
	nan

	nan
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
	1.058666931917971
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
	1.06077065155273
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
	1.0406251268522435
quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise
	1.0607269406304252
full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
	1.097143749756377
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
	1.0770749668610844

	nan
     "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
	1.057347393302865
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
	1.0374973556346236
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
	1.061421442635269
     you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
	1.0627508903853442
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
	1.0586326427068775
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
	1.0365369253813408
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
	1.0693395387566866
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
	1.0524915761537827
     You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
	1.0671053791258847
     attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
	0.0
     demand it of your justice.
	1.0107747098443167

	nan
     "Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
	1.0805949418152108
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned
	1.0700072600493473
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached
	1.0641888957418284
     Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in
	1.0867084273296015
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
	1.0385151798444834
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.
	1.0627619273411886
     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
	1.0808869861357218
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
	1.0718176679189844
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
	1.0571327176783416
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
	1.0645860998456926
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
	1.0693753508830164
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But
	1.087388033747451
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
	1.070776889959583
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
	1.016582494529732
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
	1.0288448032264976
     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is
	1.059154456457592
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
	0.0
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The
	1.0749589824704016
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I
	1.0442677535305436
     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
	1.0677488786168747
     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
	1.0372574938575627
     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the
	1.0931941769586446
     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a
	1.0631306084937129
     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that
	1.0637141644040762
     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made
	1.079919821789267
     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that
	1.0392701085991833
     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
	1.0742367796530665
     expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,
	1.0675249478666111
     of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I
	1.0796994733095095
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then
	0.0
     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
	1.0599613450697
     ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and
	1.0711029748296657
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
	1.0426136078076118
     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the
	1.0449487229350167
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
	1.0467645627431232
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
	1.0444437201255412
     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have
	1.0586481943408605
     been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
	1.0737170816697517
     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
	1.0989621074220175
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
	1.0571639587611164
     unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
	1.0693305595794447
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
	1.0780413245691365
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
	1.0573163559970915
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was
	0.0
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will
	1.043717646030471
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
	1.0581212578774615
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be
	1.0849200035694104
     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
	1.0333872179160022
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to
	1.058508880728214
     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged
	1.057319456352628
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
	1.0835934038958517
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
	1.072018492032953
     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of
	1.0627669137800118
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
	1.0441693940866326
     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
	1.0530687375146401
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes
	1.0108560949050194
     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's
	1.053988753000333
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
	1.0354732264918765
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
	1.029154070010494
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
	1.0568997146247798
     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst
	1.0901152428329077
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
	1.0614331232260894
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
	1.0331260933177833
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
	1.0425089843836612
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
	1.069445345548984
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
	1.0412360797514462
     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that
	1.0856358899072285
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
	1.0498734587502134
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
	1.0420350034717407
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
	1.057680403756515
     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
	1.064381885322932
     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
	1.0558829138827714
     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His
	1.0785125647253462
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
	1.0467451986294085
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
	1.0449686115616441
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
	1.0806407909449172
     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly
	1.0406335728247034
     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
	1.044017775362692
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and
	1.082181914024806
     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have
	1.0534827093431052
     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it
	1.0660574045723963
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
	1.0551386025330052
     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your
	1.0731366799412474
     sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his
	1.0610440346664813
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has
	0.0
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
	1.0335241348537672
     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
	1.0657272911531446
     himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against
	1.0414976999696184
     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
	1.0239197502265762
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for
	1.0819291460953462
     having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the
	1.0777652733588678
     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
	1.0535771146915998
     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
	1.0874304912269837
     conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as
	1.0921204215063505
     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
	1.0769041093188023
     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
	1.0635797065425245
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
	1.041997416945865
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this
	1.0736154095700934
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,
	1.0493346927768148
     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more
	1.1026436975744562
     to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's
	1.1003767951577843
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
	1.0378389926363925
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
	1.0212054186206594
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more
	1.0773497009858781
     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only
	1.0673001978084016
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
	1.0802094515930434
     family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but
	1.067040208709554
     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one
	1.0892062724270988
     witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very
	1.0813895826226623
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
	1.0662111265276686
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
	1.062815695807212
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
	1.0587517868315788
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
	1.0621027246817185
     liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and
	1.0346492764091528
     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
	1.030803507557204
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
	1.0475454527440355
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not
	1.0810187317880693
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
	1.0575085217273765
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
	1.0732195791369563
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.
	1.055087887435315
     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think
	1.093051241808009
     of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the
	1.0722034822057325
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
	1.0536053666253957
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
	1.0786638927503862
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
	1.0705673524390278
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.
	1.0619814166237325
     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.
	1.0854025179255173
     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a
	1.082317411209928
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
	1.0464833250272747
     real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father
	1.0479560606715261
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to
	1.0760874461103127
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
	1.0712207307805641
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
	1.0776561899591626
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
	1.0057200929390375
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
	1.0183023477141562
     vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own
	1.077222018795038
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
	1.0650278272208447
     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
	1.0588083672859854
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
	1.0396734584340679
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
	1.0444179795621293
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
	1.058380440017603
     benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
	1.0562855363901302
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
	1.0818649304210928
     be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than
	1.0604306810321638
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
	1.0411579572708756
     accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a
	1.1121424301235756
     clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all
	1.0459399577962927
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
	1.065013142912456
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
	1.058224016839089
     thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I
	1.0673430365839283
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
	1.047811648753185
     society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
	1.0629976595335913
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
	1.0741520969221436
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
	1.0592543023422745
     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
	1.0773017690803448
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
	1.0617747429385074
     to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he
	1.0750576838294374
     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
	1.0438385946179312
     exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
	1.047055297716269
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
	1.0680827870243075
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
	0.0
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
	1.0731199607953816
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
	1.0645817963516802
     father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to
	1.0625343965276735
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
	1.059020505297887
     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
	1.0601899149294982
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
	1.0488624942465132
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every
	1.0837267737558574
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But
	1.0730834621319185
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I
	1.0629100611534643
     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
	1.0563482649274702
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
	1.060060619493812
     me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no
	1.0874090294615486
     doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my
	1.0803057070531987
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
	1.0753781096955017
     Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from
	1.0770697925958712
     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
	1.0428611905095289
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;
	1.0737768522493307
     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
	1.0725768826190285
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
	1.0452034417220002
     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
	1.0580556577922515
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
	1.0575552832853385
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
	1.0291661967826549
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
	1.0552958817052998
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but
	1.076136790599158
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
	1.0399820710865288
     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
	1.0810450151991158
     herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
	1.060978408266636
     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea
	1.0329234352596688
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
	1.0828903157403336
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt
	1.0897189059054189
     and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings
	1.0792375514085777
     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left
	1.071471553398768
     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from
	1.0763871673231484
     her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
	1.0734593705440683
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
	1.0497869049720734
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
	1.0626954239568192
     strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.
	1.0454013305352283
     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
	1.0763906513853203
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
	1.0440706383712266
     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
	1.0561107951227433
     towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of
	1.0811041917248858
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
	1.0538219498793497
     be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
	1.0593450818937908
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
	1.0425904104857016
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly
	1.0456739678320628
     wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then
	1.0854524363064286
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.
	1.0663479070070294
     For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more
	1.0786621104808118
     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our
	1.051193181936756
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
	1.0505961909955788
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
	1.0697452390179933
     with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of
	1.065672219770171
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
	1.0295766154412493
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
	1.0808406538753266
     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find
	1.0605002118306217
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
	1.060862501058952
     of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.

CHAPTER XIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
	1.1001011606918263
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
	1.079028623334005
its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
	1.0762380371896356
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
	1.0707488348447711
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
	1.0835808005866088
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
	1.0770481102491636
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
	1.065323353002865
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
	1.0767905641840527
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
	1.0582851860773852
what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which
	1.060245546539258
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
	1.0407355825044484
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
	1.0643051800562595
sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's
	1.0813605849690768
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
	1.0563527108097515
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
	1.1002050965833552
any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had
	1.0907620710182362
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It
	1.0702244377715249
was all pride and insolence.
	1.022515950563477

	nan
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when
	1.0897537227833758
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
	1.0590529026605413
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
	1.0703219827578057
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
	1.0636947336351548
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
	1.0528457756719527
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
	1.0531128124654716
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
	1.0514191291576307
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
	1.084150774348374
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
	1.0000805242574595
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
	1.063892886430316
regard it, that she would never look in it again.
	1.0480977189078122

	nan
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
	1.0708619242773083
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
	1.074331112906393
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
	1.0631173464695785
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
	1.058302208675009
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
	1.0532834315516462
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly
	1.0682936882187508
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,
	1.0770125502343995
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
	1.0532689434644869
own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
	1.0886025998474869
the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
	1.0939804020181978
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
	1.078900088911575
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
	1.0637202059850952
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
	1.0707999809849291
not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
	1.0903686091356053
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
	1.025984830689677
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
	1.0948218413423891
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the
	1.0728995624227056
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
	1.026453540093225
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
	1.0623594270823538
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.
	1.097465460071139
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
	1.0741192682812248
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
	1.0266851956397742
render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
	1.0915978985286314
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
	1.010320409475737

	nan
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
	1.0608567291897322
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
	1.0942786531012287
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
	1.0316680887554213
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
	1.0459015531950064
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
	1.0661115664935912
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,
	1.0810388899843224
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to
	1.0650304458645086
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
	1.0594663285048973
felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had
	0.0
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to
	1.0729065835544356
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
	1.0298258043777333
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
	1.07318238118421
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
	1.0761112778207418
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy
	1.0758738876587797
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no
	1.0860274963690244
such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
	1.0594834415721788
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
	1.0810559037613279
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
	1.041251158211463
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
	1.0901444754110872
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
	1.0587481395733054
read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
	1.0755599604877222
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
	1.0098184613846657
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
	1.0723963701232557
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
	1.0621654409335892
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
	1.0450587521160108
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
	1.072810485243985
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
	0.0
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
	1.0749471199246476
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
	1.0783863220428596
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
	1.0787214810951036
cousin's corroboration.
	1.0025825958911492

	nan
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
	1.0515043785437874
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.
	1.0810442297978593
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
	1.0878972123996884
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
	0.0
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
	1.0720518038601394
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
	1.0524893622730258
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
	1.079841651551044
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
	1.1029176821220426
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
	1.0662200340868295
the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield
	1.0808033097742185
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
	1.0807350219376524
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
	1.0477159462517216
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.
	1.0515675979194758
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
	1.0641408372371135
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.
	1.03880113809983

	nan
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!
	1.0647688960861388
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
	1.090865143201023
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
	1.0685879743884308
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.
	1.08992222090909
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
	1.0763484213614865
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
	1.0467938274920277
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
	1.0630208600451023
incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
	1.0669303370891907
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
	1.0869049855163544
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
	1.0761008916004906
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
	1.0678878767119215
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
	1.0677456375499335
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
	1.0355525357674482
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
	1.0793493813779234
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
	1.076784805093473
of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was
	1.083730693699747
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
	1.0605682277296793
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
	1.0538387245022096
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. That had
	1.0822236199357864
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
	1.0639337296577913
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
	1.062713400852993
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
	1.0762387125408102
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.
	1.0309422352626652

	nan
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
	1.075245501956039
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
	1.0562189330042877
prejudiced, absurd.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on
	1.0868993401281943
my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
	1.0595827254097463
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
	1.055027836457169
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this
	1.0190243848321607
discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could
	1.0638145324380661
not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my
	1.0844588174343333
folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
	1.0789570279134244
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
	1.087840585886523
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
	1.0374337484930796
concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself."
	1.0523061570186345

	nan
From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
	1.09407557282604
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation
	1.0632728526266932
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely
	1.058936377566628
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that
	1.0809812817696582
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
	1.0623013926546068
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally
	1.06063954819943
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
	1.0639075861077012
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she
	1.0536837237643044
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's
	1.0840347500420202
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
	1.035361915322066
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
	1.0243422691758377
sensibility.
	nan

	nan
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
	1.091751633126081
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
	1.053751864220793
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
	1.0915367491207948
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
	1.0566503334159176
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
	1.0484190574015595
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
	0.0
than on hers.
	0.998453715081148

	nan
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed,
	1.0769092632390571
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
	1.0710198483048845
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
	1.0537778529033683
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
	1.0756199403042979
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
	0.0
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
	1.0659178877889286
had ever known before.
	1.0128632287013362

	nan
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
	1.0730282048183266
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
	1.0287439874229818
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
	1.0871790841070352
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
	1.0664595434484445
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
	1.07667777220157
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
	1.0294814983857232
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
	1.0240088449603038

	nan
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
	1.078507053499276
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
	1.0527777586374216
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
	1.0567268810117307
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
	1.0661476881067322
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
	1.0623120073706753
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
	1.0707773749137126
longer an object. She could think only of her letter.

CHAPTER XIV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having
	1.086570341414014
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
	1.0755747197405279
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
	1.0693551130257868
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
	1.0608705790207213
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
	1.0726071990372905
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
	1.0516514419770555
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
	1.0344591558795964
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
	1.086918530461853
having them all to dine with her.
	1.0187650422895405

	nan
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had
	1.0528010679658677
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
	1.093270305773969
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
	1.0391835598908743
ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have said?--how
	1.0689991738502032
would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.
	1.0658267044072167

	nan
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure
	1.0904488327490753
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody
	1.054348551503578
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
	1.1008070726825516
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
	1.0764749763601
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear
	1.0764184740825298
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
	0.0
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year. His
	1.0758001876679844
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."
	1.007721503948798

	nan
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
	1.0943504227246716
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
	1.0488295428262329

	nan
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
	1.0645443474499374
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
	1.0497413810654477
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,
	1.0669972130417773

	nan
"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
	1.1118994236623119
may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
	1.067062001794661
company, I am sure."
	1.0117318413429612

	nan
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
	1.070449578570231
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town
	1.1115932746114698
next Saturday."
	0.9983925046471629

	nan
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
	1.091174804534014
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
	1.1060713426728725
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
	1.0852686100524767
spare you for another fortnight."
	1.0200418763482304

	nan
"But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."
	1.0867905140694045

	nan
"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters
	1.083361964870626
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
	1.0867336957244633
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
	1.0618374975002953
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
	1.0644886321428637
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room
	1.0932721156788021
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
	1.0933764350746364
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."
	1.0800566560184555

	nan
"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
	1.074361841658253
original plan."
	1.0007687312601699

	nan
Lady Catherine seemed resigned.
	1.0200005274175798

	nan
"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always
	1.097402375086421
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
	1.0732511212862579
post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send
	1.0725326189768927
somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
	0.0
thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
	1.041451044224647
according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to
	1.064257810520364
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
	1.0882133375781975
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady
	1.1075452440813691
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I
	1.074532333550133
am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with
	1.0691907404566265
the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention
	1.109838229555988
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."
	1.0799483810917765

	nan
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."
	1.05680923818841

	nan
"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
	1.094951061508591
have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change
	1.035522642645579
horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,
	1.0837330521926472
you will be attended to."
	1.009758783397488

	nan
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
	1.0650132115021897
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
	1.0641983661280385
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
	1.0733634684721172
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
	0.0
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
	1.0610476520873813
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
	1.0881601401410137
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
	1.0627664034603133
recollections.
	nan

	nan
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
	1.127825888471004
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
	1.0331756811057513
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
	0.0
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
	1.0668284754767474
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
	1.0592863574135272
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
	1.0572508113815278
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
	1.0481034428984157
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
	1.0752627930627212
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
	0.0
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
	1.0691950122103655
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
	1.0874267122624086
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
	1.0735791481210317
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
	1.0625576009737263
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
	1.0313357758587416
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
	1.0563586526794533
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
	1.0625068516633631
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
	1.0689189168736404
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
	1.0425336940662988
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
	1.049979341313925
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
	1.0556780330686606
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
	1.0743120611109211
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
	1.06976912573113
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
	1.07765204941534
ever.
	nan

	nan
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.
	1.072893848326698
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
	1.0690008997340377
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was
	1.057465860628641
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
	1.0465149492660923
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
	1.0680067160726017
friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
	1.0685265708892941
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
	1.053735379778016
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
	1.072928303869741
family!
	nan

	nan
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
	1.0686601266601123
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
	1.030796754235719
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
	1.0314696927189064
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
	1.030471243206924

	nan
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
	1.0732409153522888
her stay, as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
	1.0829579476587798
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
	1.0617460443917717
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
	1.0651263273788223
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
	1.0939632883413075
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
	1.070868141239751
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
	1.0455793815698684

	nan
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
	1.0516591723355018
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
	1.0791843049405974
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
	1.0975089673060425
hand to both.

On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
	1.084225920866154
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
	1.0579127378380415
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
	1.0433879416738725

	nan
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet
	1.0777888618244684
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
	1.055111701254853
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
	1.0508867611062311
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know
	1.106547078628707
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. Our plain
	1.090862264788172
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
	1.0619823197719793
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
	1.085110584780746
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
	1.0541891152956036
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
	1.0895883543287783
your time unpleasantly."
	1.0059610940934514

	nan
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had
	1.080495216027145
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
	1.0210579021631938
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
	1.068897870845791
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
	0.0
solemnity replied,
	nan

	nan
"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
	1.0766356740345433
time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most
	1.057407190959155
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
	1.0235954860139835
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
	1.0571654152453245
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
	1.0691900546738102
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation
	1.0622891903037999
with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of
	1.0772608337384002
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on
	0.0
what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In
	1.0902536205426854
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
	1.0623070899757374
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of
	1.0691763472922056
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."
	1.028730687504765

	nan
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
	1.0764413892074232
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
	1.0445378734485709
and truth in a few short sentences.
	1.041272573145685

	nan
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
	1.069158414236565
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
	1.075936993177784
be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
	1.1034505302909805
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
	1.0757559851090421
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
	1.0877379461079244
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
	1.0836204631329187
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
	1.0757526989448223
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
	0.0
thinking. There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
	1.064141905096309
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
	1.0563237923949773
other."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
	1.0751148828300476
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
	1.0705812516958977
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
	1.0782891511774926
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
	1.0803122591068257
whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
	1.060797936635838
such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
	1.074419739383254
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
	1.062181387319822
ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
	1.0639774719555106
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
	1.0575379960594862
charms.
	nan

	nan
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
	1.0794652907657714
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
	1.0697458900396664
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
	1.0564128278924803
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
	1.0761030546321526
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
	1.0730528972613773
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
	1.0787575384448962
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
	1.0807635688910004
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
	1.09583489355991
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
	1.048684312062442
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.
	1.0719019279971909

	nan
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
	1.0709140196840563
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
	1.057622437950757
while you have been here."
	1.0086025199584325

	nan
Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
	1.081951104990815
the carriage drove off.
	1.021193326143437

	nan
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
	1.0726729327667344
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
	1.0865327296284917
happened!"
	nan

	nan
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.
	1.062074790985921

	nan
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
	1.0610270908013115
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"
	1.0278202205466422

	nan
Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."
	1.068326398640457

	nan
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
	1.0607546554451748
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's
	1.0537928952413458
house, where they were to remain a few days.
	1.0375529797814946

	nan
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
	1.0649747834026646
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
	1.0564870220703826
had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
	1.09135749456257
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
	1.0432596362613957

	nan
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
	1.076036164037912
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know
	1.0995805168702288
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
	1.0777303370535674
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
	1.0934012435306895
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
	1.0465254866159366
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
	1.0719485143003968
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
	1.079701775064362
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
	1.0939723410725923
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
	1.0420811824647012
farther.

CHAPTER XVI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
	1.1038923441771178
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
	1.0482255699890497
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was
	1.1008550729789195
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
	1.068173513116365
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up
	1.06487612774803
stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
	1.0869238437839321
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
	1.0511339657208505
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.
	1.0314170207736089

	nan
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
	1.0523846910324735
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
	1.0520290040959037
"Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?"
	1.0539343412599644

	nan
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the
	1.0902335206041265
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing
	1.0809142294014837
her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it
	1.0926803042663649
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
	1.1039454553890433
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
	1.122557200310039
better."
	nan

	nan
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
	1.065893976649681
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
	1.083430724948916
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
	1.080401793950006
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
	1.0743409052588322
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
	1.0663588300887896
are going in a fortnight."
	1.0157234118557876

	nan
"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
	1.0571600936166479

	nan
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
	1.0976970163957225
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,
	1.058730865669158
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. Mamma would like to
	1.1014098379992692
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
	1.0710915382434845
have!"
	nan

	nan
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
	1.0563323484909921
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
	1.0897258506160021
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
	1.0809943164314044
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."
	1.0516882919529098

	nan
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to
	1.0907827671473542
table. "What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about
	1.057212379589213
a certain person that we all like."
	1.0388584077333256

	nan
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
	1.0911316879396602
need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,
	1.035394456166713

	nan
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
	1.0839269925728015
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
	1.0649993660606234
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
	1.0625674535871639
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
	1.1301984261845244
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
	1.09395829973344
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She
	1.115765358750907
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe."
	1.1054001909875824

	nan
"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
	1.0698968583422255
imprudent as to fortune."
	1.0025002851357174

	nan
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."
	1.0806256207745608

	nan
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.
	1.0887737672357698

	nan
"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it he never cared
	1.107319816048857
three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
	1.0746938740702014
thing?"
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
	1.055910393949941
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
	1.0461654390057509
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
	1.0621926984855787
liberal!
	nan

	nan
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
	1.089406119959455
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
	1.0627203223422814
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
	1.08030475649914
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.
	1.0420088289332532

	nan
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my
	1.0981210081996404
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
	1.065897957087764
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
	1.0698549539279492
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
	1.0953514452056323
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
	1.0401704491927974
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
	1.083129765491724
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
	1.078800375494518
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
	1.0880875897849902
being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to
	1.0658401323586315
get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
	1.0789631201374361
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
	1.1026455791774827
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
	1.08544060725096
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
	1.1081559831473586
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend
	1.1071371889259285
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
	1.1037232540699393
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
	1.0827887266982839
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
	1.0940996163796686
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
	1.0838218522635326
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
	1.08138862859547
lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs.
	1.1072504220505766
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
	1.0845942408049583
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
	1.0741779397996434
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
	1.1021352218429363
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
	1.1128622085188664
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
	1.1015516937670047
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."
	1.0590737605737481

	nan
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
	1.0815525620208533
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
	1.0442409405234414
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
	1.0524004383220458
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.
	1.0893573989929912

	nan
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
	1.0966326662882482
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
	1.072865650669907
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,
	0.0

	nan
"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."
	1.0383844871349053

	nan
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
	1.085452487298669
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
	0.0
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
	1.0596158898276629
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was
	1.0736277980724827
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
	1.061416349142957
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
	1.0692590696015585
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
	1.0872641156972809
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
	1.0320216837841991
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.
	1.0716801079067002

	nan
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
	1.1034789758048382
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
	1.0825374378358734
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
	1.1000275788595644
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
	1.1107404996067376
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
	1.0675381436374431
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
	1.0578141061369308
treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought
	1.07832732502618
we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.
	1.0973546883123084
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
	1.0940755098114499
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"
	0.0

	nan
To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
	1.0872781415464845
to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with
	1.0702272904363765
the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms
	1.0908068507572957
for _me_. I should infinitely prefer a book."
	1.0479674040744222

	nan
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to any
	1.0947354458821341
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
	1.0744724373587666

	nan
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
	1.1105662616484087
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
	1.0690370765245119
the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
	1.1121206332045237
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was
	1.0857095364796
another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
	1.0272239407979358
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_,
	1.0861808397253345
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In
	1.0761056441326906
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
	1.0823757809557597
nothing more to plague her on his account.
	1.0297994587297976

	nan
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
	1.0872301949921912
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
	1.072767711995644
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
	1.0522972474102732
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
	1.0637081255324656
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
	1.0819690099276413
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

CHAPTER XVII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
	1.0751490932743555
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
	1.0312478849967612
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
	1.0643312331484223
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.
	1.107637175222029
Darcy and herself.
	1.01156954542894

	nan
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
	1.0680455851267239
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
	0.0
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
	1.0671577668294634
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
	1.076398657811714
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
	1.07397322877319
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.
	1.047910551665108

	nan
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
	1.070894236129392
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
	1.0624335025789198
disappointment."
	nan

	nan
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
	1.0691023434302003
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
	1.0593247591939714
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
	1.0446712519192216

	nan
"Blame you! Oh, no."
	1.0157452663155186

	nan
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."
	1.0650855779561295

	nan
"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
	1.0856756006946424

	nan
"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
	1.0743346469973605
next day."
	0.9983925046471629

	nan
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
	1.0911153916002296
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
	1.0822828008423118
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
	1.0513144083999397
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
	1.0796486901932423
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
	1.0362323857013318
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
	1.0458361947520407
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
	1.0755099567160895
seek to clear one, without involving the other.
	1.0463423228651625

	nan
"This will not do," said Elizabeth. "You never will be able to make both
	1.0943455373657196
of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
	1.0902402111330742
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
	1.1016077557661559
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
	1.0854278003585804
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.
	1.0875631247135915
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."
	1.050007524946736

	nan
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
	1.086154321705725

	nan
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so
	1.0935521554494319
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only
	1.109490674583956
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
	1.0523145944713022
knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of
	1.0696721105876792
his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
	1.090027634324634
so."
	nan

	nan
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
	1.0891609533203377
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
	1.0932054757663527
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
	1.0469439306834276
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
	1.0636256005380635
be as light as a feather."
	1.0207076291673702

	nan
"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
	1.0670607671166286
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner."
	1.03894716205762

	nan
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
	1.0679568755639448
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
	1.1037223288136806
appearance of it."
	0.9990429894227727

	nan
"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
	1.100231013255377
used to do."
	0.9857637042830113

	nan
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
	1.0930101195504693
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
	1.1201496246468658
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
	1.0853513527576368
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
	1.0586859676405376
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."
	1.0684390993598758

	nan
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
	1.076380936957655
the matter as you do now."
	1.0352500792955877

	nan
"Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very
	1.0801432944216793
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I
	1.0924547007575456
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
	0.0
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"
	1.0618168976417242

	nan
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
	1.0589578172722496
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
	1.089480059825321
undeserved."
	nan

	nan
"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
	1.0794424483612621
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is
	1.0680523722479995
one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
	1.0934934617819625
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
	1.0547475675307023
Wickham's character."
	1.0120159653125875

	nan
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
	1.0822426201997863
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?"
	1.0626561216457446

	nan
"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to
	1.1024850184892891
make his communication public. On the contrary every particular relative
	1.0588694959299005
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
	1.0930645281854305
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
	1.0904792652407862
will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent,
	1.0582828250978686
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
	1.0946468484918845
attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham
	1.076926657007493
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
	1.0533215710138124
what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
	1.0907192856810566
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will
	1.0626697045355522
say nothing about it."
	0.0

	nan
"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
	1.0922145402764627
ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
	1.0781703073318918
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate."
	1.0611067416358524

	nan
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
	1.091817407788376
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
	1.065128795602931
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
	1.0799208863428267
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
	1.0779176453290338
of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
	1.0799609384851057
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
	1.0922804691525516
had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could
	1.092404650565901
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
	1.0395272815525451
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
	1.0570526836030651
last incumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very
	1.067286096672669
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
	1.072279118597506
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
	1.0658948396442565
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"
	1.0694907767428894

	nan
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
	1.0899919246047174
state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
	0.0
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in
	1.0745496940190356
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
	1.0535606498884602
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
	1.0469848083109614
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
	1.0513090680979673
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
	1.0795060772921006
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
	1.0604272127521086
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
	1.0592963593804718
tranquillity.
	nan

	nan
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
	1.0949953368250782
this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak
	1.0770105297883665
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I
	1.1216016388089876
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London. Well, he is a
	1.0738063371315518
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
	1.0787600184801962
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his
	1.1051794924774767
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
	1.0741536450205746
body too, who is likely to know."
	1.0118576523793972

	nan
"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."
	1.0799624626972113

	nan
"Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
	1.1125615431711742
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
	1.0613018926443962
her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure
	1.108389076801401
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
	1.0964326471236114
has done."
	0.9981310318826466

	nan
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
	1.060218960336005
she made no answer.
	1.0167282551875418

	nan
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
	1.0564779640550912
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
	1.0696475064151456
will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
	1.0660467309927004
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,
	1.0747462060658302
she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
	1.066016946095783
housekeeping, I dare say."
	1.0054770755936082

	nan
"No, nothing at all."
	1.0149110411072004

	nan
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will
	1.0907101219902289
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
	1.0632039960617023
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
	1.0996243924381393
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it
	1.0798438190184956
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."
	1.0473523281079

	nan
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."
	1.0654185463112398

	nan
"No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they
	1.116483490519015
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
	1.0818549666359885
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be
	1.0784622494416227
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."

CHAPTER XVIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
	1.1028239056369484
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
	1.1108673197513836
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
	1.0596015247277608
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
	1.07762909668294
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
	1.072056030171812
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
	1.040051253577639
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
	1.0643663688642357
hard-heartedness in any of the family.
	1.039136991898757

	nan
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they
	1.103762369796674
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so,
	1.0829084080942457
Lizzy?"
	nan

	nan
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
	1.053862684561221
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
	1.0718106038715778
ago.
	nan

	nan
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
	1.076778916441182
Millar's regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart."
	1.0953104078744835

	nan
"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.
	1.051277814142885

	nan
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.
	1.0722653453215176

	nan
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
	1.0773850240446508
disagreeable."
	nan

	nan
"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."
	1.0632382388442772

	nan
"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
	1.0950777217666945
added Kitty.
	0.0

	nan
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
	1.0526865124046934
Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
	1.0813229547369587
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's
	1.120129495696696
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
	1.0674183069902863
interference in the views of his friend.
	1.0325838350366636

	nan
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
	1.0838305201844756
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the
	1.063483999778144
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
	1.0725369753822904
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
	1.0835602751000721
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
	1.0869007477349248
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
	1.0409695286496297

	nan
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
	1.080472923150064
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
	1.094092000804931
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew
	1.0851105596770225
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
	1.0601128889526177
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
	1.046978112838992
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
	1.0717444565363838
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
	1.0484543516777274

	nan
"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
	1.0887862477322479
said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
	1.0780781341672712
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."
	1.1023017690780295

	nan
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
	1.0822636197728612
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
	1.073176913844557
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
	1.0930042241153686
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
	1.0689723155128767
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
	1.091557073531517
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
	1.0609919313165996
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
	1.074187323517139
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
	1.0653374943725669
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
	1.104171172595822
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
	1.057009427268652
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,
	1.0584762319706498

	nan
"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
	1.0752610591561285
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
	1.0629186780223479
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
	1.0287686772019353
circumstances."
	nan

	nan
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
	1.072539985626037
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
	1.0331229277853253
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
	1.0457933805617912
would judge differently in the affair."
	1.0263020637413918

	nan
"Already arisen!" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away
	1.0778153886383557
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
	1.0894499274593235
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
	1.0717318411576249
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
	1.101895681572402
who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."
	1.040179013740766

	nan
"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
	1.104887194695901
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
	1.0708330706776887
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
	1.0494604219030041
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
	1.0578635231310118
Lydia's character. Excuse me--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
	1.10378588399744
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
	1.0624509970185316
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
	1.080873226780059
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
	1.0817631334811801
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
	1.0557506233602794
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the
	1.0839984790921917
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
	1.0410876163257734
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
	1.0708244030976617
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
	1.0674684003480086
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty
	1.0604550845142156
is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
	1.072663570612733
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you
	1.047897703843868
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
	1.0393650611746141
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
	1.0605360246080435
disgrace?"
	nan

	nan
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
	1.083659301415018
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,
	1.0162108598858206

	nan
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,
	1.0840257121256838
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
	1.0621300093556703
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
	1.065361554472204
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
	1.0884366438857191
Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
	1.1005625037478393
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
	1.0903604355285978
object of prey to any body. At Brighton she will be of less importance
	1.0970749201718162
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
	1.0892147565805528
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
	1.029840439996577
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
	1.0779339399430772
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
	1.080339505106715
of her life."
	1.0099300984655126

	nan
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
	1.0807931736598095
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
	1.0853198413824299
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.
	1.0751664531664153
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
	1.0702632248595134
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
	1.072467733112831
disposition.
	nan

	nan
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
	1.0878649568676007
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
	1.0413252992475246
united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
	1.0659935347064382
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of
	1.0873367931507631
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She
	0.0
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
	1.0929309217145982
present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
	0.0
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
	1.0646819951488542
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
	1.0896970580355614
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
	1.0650966628213678
officers at once.
	0.0

	nan
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
	1.0892292962849917
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could
	1.067249098012513
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
	1.056215116104078
same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
	1.0899738067393652
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
	1.0574723791944647
himself.
	nan

	nan
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
	1.064090430942515
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
	1.0734501479643297
home.
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
	1.1048292034327107
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
	1.0522172511915737
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
	1.0788066033719592
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
	1.0671480257279358
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
	1.0736897874549256
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
	1.060022815470181
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
	1.059913821585831
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
	1.0731433024970707
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
	1.0830585584271548
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
	0.0
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
	1.0544762965261714
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
	1.0363371106706307
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
	1.052014945514325
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.
	1.0561605119570632

	nan
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined
	1.0994042221753413
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
	1.073298195096092
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
	1.0644220256309447
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
	1.0738513563780172
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three
	1.0810081099202722
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.
	1.0715678207122656

	nan
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
	1.0531847816262492
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
	1.0490105237500627
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
	1.059868812406559
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
	1.0884882825196323
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you
	1.0712116388067683
say that he was at Rosings?"
	0.0

	nan
"Nearly three weeks."
	1.0092847368468487

	nan
"And you saw him frequently?"
	1.014449938778052

	nan
"Yes, almost every day."
	1.0189962301162074

	nan
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."
	1.0563771443442445

	nan
"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance."
	1.097239948084979

	nan
"Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And pray
	1.0860914279233664
may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in
	1.0745809951597203
address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
	1.0751603976998965
ordinary style? for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
	1.0692567362905798
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."
	1.0254726354870527

	nan
"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much
	1.0828457929101243
what he ever was."
	1.0034293653976019

	nan
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
	1.0634289382032394
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
	1.0575591030140352
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
	1.0519599130904247
and anxious attention, while she added,
	1.0232639427806225

	nan
"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
	1.0779492755584525
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
	1.0686244384386172
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."
	1.0271224095132216

	nan
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
	1.064746669549148
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
	1.0427143783817647
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
	1.0546215766663591
accents,
	nan

	nan
"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
	1.0793927080548877
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
	1.0602395907122069
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
	1.0782936796964038
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
	1.0722984479923838
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that
	1.0807839307994453
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
	1.0734454217082057
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
	1.0835476960125843
judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I
	1.0841458863052702
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
	1.0795479105807702
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
	1.084251942939491
has very much at heart."
	1.0178644687534844

	nan
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
	1.085776477807528
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
	1.075214995214335
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
	1.0938845471925125
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
	1.082699688373144
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
	1.0508868448388553
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
	1.067163480132776
mutual desire of never meeting again.
	1.0237812499497603

	nan
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
	1.0878762557888875
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
	1.0793039911151494
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
	1.0794375798402507
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
	1.0924000952283355
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
	1.0825318968111444
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
	1.063858237889463
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
	1.04784245389072
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
	1.0747902307065618
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
	1.0532808643979539
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

CHAPTER XIX.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
	1.0817836581293134
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
	1.0673102760332547
comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
	0.0
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
	1.0660891921396853
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
	1.0297675395898904
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
	1.0528221116223275
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
	1.0510657159798587
domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a
	1.0577049581014375
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
	1.0489975497071382
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
	1.058046076835186
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
	1.0782276336187673
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
	1.0854543822415192
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
	1.0832800804408362
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
	1.080408617125063
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
	1.099557214770463
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
	1.038722399013547
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
	1.0527475925856324

	nan
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
	1.0680383988912212
father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
	1.0894719686739271
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
	1.0420870989059294
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
	1.0587144391217476
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
	1.0437924814479143
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
	1.0773497031656503
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
	1.05900826282971
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
	1.0517918908843042
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
	1.059974127346896
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
	1.0490013724939762
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
	1.0158170262739368
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
	1.0579479816248571

	nan
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little
	1.0654575941363018
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
	1.0799211471362176
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
	1.065963713107865
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
	1.0512254093326536
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
	1.0574723456186137
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
	1.044263710893986
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
	1.0590629072298052
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
	0.0
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
	1.0731828312386622
place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
	1.0709256373101608
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
	1.0611656548032444
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
	1.0579394886158366
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
	1.055954345381573
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
	1.042115852086205
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
	1.0679905306212423
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
	1.0477880987900396
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
	0.0
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
	1.0817598296196311
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
	1.0595853216158466
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
	1.0643203796343943
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
	1.0660971305512832

	nan
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.
	1.0887816934139163
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
	1.065017153309329
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
	1.0851984033729751
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
	1.0677990640852089
pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
	1.0655694812836787
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
	1.0136868952756979
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."
	1.0430520828344865

	nan
When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
	1.0822816832336688
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
	1.0794754071876147
always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
	0.0
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
	1.057525434290325
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
	1.0658626667701931
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
	1.079647550883627
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
	1.0834725553725135
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the
	1.0667338461814777
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
	1.058937720183623
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
	1.0795698537132585
too full of lines under the words to be made public.
	1.0586104659761033

	nan
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
	1.0745213502646855
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore
	1.0480582999651566
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
	1.09559371273437
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
	1.077911807923082
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
	1.0810712636067263
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
	1.0801785995016329
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
	1.0759836506555513
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
	1.0736719139635256
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
	1.0642233322552488
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
	1.0454599382760927
Meryton.
	nan

	nan
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast
	1.0780211390735628
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
	1.059404050488187
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
	1.0576670445774239
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
	1.0838752999341845
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
	1.0722295539606166
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
	1.0837421368218842
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
	1.06214047130254
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
	1.081620927767342
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
	1.0806262443824937
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that
	0.0
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
	1.0710492461242667
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
	1.081930632597217
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
	1.067006125590313
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
	1.0732249573612387
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
	1.0517492733696467
Dovedale, or the Peak.
	1.020707726072971

	nan
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
	1.0618165691865413
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
	1.0894726429315462
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
	1.0732304765055063
and all was soon right again.
	1.0319103758558947

	nan
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was
	1.085885236783108
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
	1.0660701070977114
owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
	1.0755902824017556
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."
	1.0817511925663816

	nan
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
	1.085884096670204
before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and
	1.0930184501011655
Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
	1.0731843044005611
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
	1.0949452879681465
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
	1.0650237397632802
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
	1.0675279908479662
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
	1.046315764729354
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
	1.0338385340013758

	nan
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
	1.084061189548112
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One
	1.0535886151903333
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
	1.0411978853383417
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
	1.0246871821358485
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
	1.0242502829347715
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
	1.054888098598944
disappointments abroad.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
	1.1006216765149825
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
	1.0552076201137022
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. are
	0.0
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
	0.0
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's
	1.0969111016587383
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
	1.0513480359188927
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
	1.0359310158755815
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
	1.073515778650608
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It
	1.0738314966663394
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
	1.109040491739885
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an
	1.0143013211214915
inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
	1.0437709958862798
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
	1.0506819380327106

	nan
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
	1.0915045196454607
much?" said her aunt. "A place too, with which so many of your
	1.0628890033239533
acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
	1.0519364804380682
know."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
	1.0719276637210777
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
	1.084083573862976
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
	1.078184995087284
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
	1.070346314959722

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house
	1.0904642310599049
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the
	1.0811431527685826
grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
	1.0740761995789552
country."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
	1.0686754707943333
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
	1.0641793131669308
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and
	1.0810653795536023
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
	1.0602956427418135
such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally
	1.0829950528123908
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
	1.0702467184812312
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.
	1.067163636126947

	nan
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
	1.0572208143860753
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
	0.0
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
	1.0709222172185053
the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
	1.0907628402190361
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
	1.088672316896546
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
	1.0796826660101526
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
	1.0568443901086149
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
	1.0739820063219454
to the scheme.
	1.0153971724737523

	nan
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

CHAPTER I.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
	1.0626922830735626
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
	1.0688507854458382
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
	1.070423013247207

	nan
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
	1.0767032826645042
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
	1.0688045949462872
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.
	1.0487465855320715

	nan
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
	1.0783127620123794
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
	1.0586728813347988
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
	1.0812802678318028
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
	1.0785903209390886
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
	1.0792870123799978
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone
	1.087187862890269
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
	1.069373675490232
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
	1.0535423193904792
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
	1.0619468299679011
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
	1.0647481224633921
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
	1.0712216717372085
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
	1.0581414686295163
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
	1.0755488745688053
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
	1.0404033439123028

	nan
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
	1.0917265289241112
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
	1.0662168558646643
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
	1.0645180335941986
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
	1.0682356565190174
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
	1.0628469794386308
wonder at her being where she was.
	1.0324197376481272

	nan
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
	1.0574167983964946
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
	1.0598257020600812
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned
	1.080367793958425
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
	1.0426708754857419
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from
	1.0954522419131025
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
	1.0356425016326545
distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was
	1.077999377699419
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
	1.0815060912745742
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
	1.0962454132833261
it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
	1.0677256809949833
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
	1.0597571796962335
be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
	1.0662382715270966
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
	1.0681632410262352
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
	1.0797666593596822
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
	1.0659230302242306

	nan
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With
	1.0695015223754007
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
	1.0387171431707556
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
	1.06656776349187
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting
	1.0679671044403802
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
	1.0619335909927108
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."
	1.0735866553566547

	nan
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.
	1.08054141774733

	nan
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
	1.0746155874481558
absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was
	1.0697822829023194
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds
	1.0740477793718783
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
	1.0671540764739347
large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
	1.01961845517828
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
	1.0479837170536297

	nan
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw
	1.0983363948608391
the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
	1.0687105768114313
over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
	1.0638528905171645
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
	1.0744161815698858
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
	1.0698154281501666
brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army,"
	1.0737474483908995
she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."
	1.0682143396401562

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
	1.0900985434193924
return it.
	0.0

	nan
"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
	1.0746390112996012
"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
	1.1150915876511198
other--about eight years ago."
	1.018253515979291

	nan
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner,
	1.0866422430947311
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
	1.0953046967004112
us whether it is like or not."
	0.0

	nan
Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
	1.0781178372127993
intimation of her knowing her master.
	1.031697251678749

	nan
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"
	1.0432921638926806

	nan
Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."
	1.0324003325834854

	nan
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"
	1.06663211977482

	nan
"Yes, very handsome."
	1.0119021206212875

	nan
"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
	1.0940127831538298
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
	1.0861992737114199
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
	1.0604694202007816
be then. He was very fond of them."
	1.0420396065954878

	nan
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.
	1.0861126522763103

	nan
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
	1.0834280083339145
when she was only eight years old.
	1.0333909754150967

	nan
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr. Gardiner.
	1.089587914094294

	nan
"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
	1.0761650499125919
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a
	1.0993567682155283
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
	1.0256993424169716
comes here to-morrow with him."
	1.022360931105246

	nan
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
	1.0665187386608403
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
	1.0614391329109478
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
	1.0612813483822299
master and his sister.
	1.0049893001011068

	nan
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"
	1.0771455819165943

	nan
"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
	1.1019048816634038
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."
	1.069567887767519

	nan
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."
	1.049863837910163

	nan
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."
	1.065308400635838

	nan
"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
	1.116293273025254
good enough for him."
	1.0037066415006004

	nan
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
	1.098892067221512
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."
	1.0839294488491202

	nan
"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
	1.098320948726662
him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
	1.0636729594564467
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
	1.0562488508361738
"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
	1.1043674101424217
ever since he was four years old."
	1.0039011327699847

	nan
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
	1.0681788993522647
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
	1.0746184546742013
opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
	1.0517158478323112
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,
	1.042205323155523

	nan
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
	1.110101529856053
having such a master."
	1.0046674522193626

	nan
"Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not
	1.1304926637981059
meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
	1.0807723469482249
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
	1.0582915046532848
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
	1.0580033744832433
world."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr. Darcy!" thought she.
	1.0998379016492987

	nan
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.
	1.0633675063286374

	nan
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
	1.096285491899771
as affable to the poor."
	1.0258999273735363

	nan
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
	1.0681694783664764
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject
	1.0787274929814736
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
	1.0973761493666365
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
	1.0798990610748045
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
	1.04551753910236
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
	1.0737735133474586
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
	1.0590654659910095

	nan
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
	1.0911017925193627
lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
	1.0971949624232558
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
	1.0862940849967389
give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
	1.0939014988787228
saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
	1.1056048010815294
away like other young men."

"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.
	1.0638213355959738

	nan
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
	1.0707279792479534
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."
	1.0449112214536114

	nan
"Perhaps we might be deceived."
	1.0215366499336953

	nan
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."
	1.0656061318720977

On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
	1.0775084151140164
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
	1.0369978424747635
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
	1.073788852673453
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
	1.0888085256203044
room, when last at Pemberley.
	1.0054103270703294

	nan
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
	1.0745716485747168
one of the windows.
	1.0142844024320918

	nan
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
	1.0794662399710904
the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever
	1.1096095695297266
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There
	1.0967861015903608
is nothing he would not do for her."
	1.036685339516569

	nan
The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
	1.0798918008011424
all that remained to be shewn. In the former were many good paintings;
	1.0865434621332004
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
	1.0887506949338226
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
	1.0691248440465613
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
	1.0629074736431379
also more intelligible.
	1.0035424607526047

	nan
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
	1.0707390792512188
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest
	1.0928239563475384
of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it
	1.0981080297356514
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with
	1.0704675019352516
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
	1.0851171142385556
when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in
	1.0756743873836394
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
	1.0520653490476708
gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
	1.0646108745669225
father's life time.
	1.0112344991786422

	nan
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
	1.0809633542896093
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
	1.0396155605526465
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
	1.0656585797354374
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
	1.084370559776344
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
	1.0667941839983883
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How
	1.0541095108218153
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of
	1.0808767969469348
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
	1.0723241488670434
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
	1.0720589435286423
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
	1.0429583231415225
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
	1.0620324380245934
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
	1.0415908869362263
softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
	1.087640963088658
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
	1.0418461698692625
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.
	1.0870876090950667

	nan
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
	1.0690149480447906
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
	1.0905843382947356
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
	1.069974887514196
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
	1.0549046884559845

	nan
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
	1.0770770544252433
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
	1.0586030959960817
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
	1.0646763101969052
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
	1.0716829558962737
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
	1.014881969865497
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
	1.081649311570616
of perfect civility.
	1.0082598368677225

	nan
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
	1.0498624529828648
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
	1.0162420221927997
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
	1.0523979010950617
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
	1.0548926952093722
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
	1.0934560396652167
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
	1.0616007304204942
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
	1.0538567431532881
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
	1.0743380745004891
returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the
	1.06055090916362
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
	1.0617807019044962
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
	1.049937279333115
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
	1.0609249717120055
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
	1.050486378961996
uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
	1.0763605348136471
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
	1.0525302152651161
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
	1.0715104719874848
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
	1.0842393281143536
distraction of his thoughts.
	1.0177244845034825

	nan
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
	1.0796374376979003
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
	1.0404231253214082
leave.
	nan

	nan
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
	1.0581166939143272
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
	1.065370707786188
feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and
	1.0529817466648566
vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
	1.07235086804531
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
	1.0752514755490947
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
	1.0842964158092505
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
	1.0835751964300213
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been
	1.0792911296216046
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
	1.0705780174509767
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
	1.0646255061649808
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and
	1.077996250820176
again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so
	1.0670615926731843
strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to
	1.0644902038565256
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
	1.0794605369902004
family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
	1.0750669789888243
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
	1.0380412221803201
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
	1.1009189213444477
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to
	1.0929224605921142
account for it.
	0.9945479189637889

	nan
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
	1.0971238713361011
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
	1.0658518541262079
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
	1.0793964721743585
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
	1.05923237741283
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
	1.0792722901160618
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
	1.069920760038702
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
	1.070624907840895
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
	1.078937989846388
was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
	1.09517865857598
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
	1.0577840332747122
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
	1.08909161626875
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
	0.0
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
	1.0938044472598334
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
	1.0668198386659855
composure.
	nan

	nan
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
	1.0842641651630613
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
	1.0724969140176066

	nan
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
	1.0873336717159112
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
	1.0498235247992402
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
	1.0990590402810145
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
	1.0739562091994104
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner
	1.0790730685740086
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
	1.0645099944776688
beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
	0.0
miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
	1.0627417225910178
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
	1.0640169220391806
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.
	1.1075648516473042
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
	1.0905354431655068
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
	1.0976055940645937
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
	1.0783501315240664
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
	1.0616275644398585
it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
	1.0733243701641724
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
	1.0795302758234957
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
	1.0718405087285945
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
	1.0615665880947347
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
	1.040401040360893
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
	1.0898237466209626
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
	1.059098672728646
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
	1.0811041399604926
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
	1.0724088577171857
about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
	1.0635590244365134
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
	1.0025133046790426
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
	1.0937664891894903
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
	1.0629970586475477
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
	1.049942637551193
met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
	1.0583000507679614
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
	1.0296224417159385
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
	1.0742782539060296
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea
	1.0796470926946353
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
	1.074306302990953
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,
	1.0582189096030636
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
	1.0746394671277224
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
	1.0717758360641045
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
	1.067888301770819
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
	1.0315805375383371
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour
	1.0567141357191043
changed, and she said no more.
	1.0208630289394816

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
	1.090684614590288
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
	1.0995451347527734
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
	1.0780016300168898
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
	1.0694314597559607
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
	1.0650470459136328
revolted, in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought
	1.0812198824959023
she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of
	1.0751144435280782
fashion."
	nan

	nan
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
	1.0624689929236746
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
	1.083949266043211
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
	1.0825364263690882
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
	1.0662040471212217
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
	1.0595030193231032
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
	1.0142418331756837
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
	1.0591765863265472
could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had
	1.0748217882776006
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
	1.0651877963984924
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
	0.0
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
	1.036175125208847
his taste, or his good manners.
	1.0261367900579463

	nan
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy
	1.0670414901309606
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
	1.0671038650552416
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
	1.055428908687571
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
	1.06454592180619
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
	1.088691658963301
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
	1.0454237184665787
wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
	1.057404611179674
compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was
	1.045806242356592
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From
	1.0533065293068438
what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
	1.0711834773391269
that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not
	1.0798101689658568
work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love
	1.0840636931225958
me."
	nan

	nan
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
	1.0909693689900957
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
	1.0391423705258838
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
	1.0520177057851818
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in
	1.074196004840135
Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
	1.0798753466438273
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
	1.0619896830177304
her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
	1.106870115435205
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to
	1.0984768136704457
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
	1.0816181708018227
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
	1.0362583113167256
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
	1.0515385137456206
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
	1.0707211728113473
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
	1.0375925709487452
the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
	1.0875429443027658
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
	1.0487915628736555
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They
	1.0802391849631539
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
	1.0510706281136284
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."
	1.0717902474602294

	nan
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
	1.0745101591555026
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned
	1.076256502879845
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
	1.0654987365516184
not very differently engaged.
	1.013829317108456

	nan
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
	1.0826534859816441
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow
	1.059485425644321
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
	1.063932565393154
during your stay at Lambton?"
	1.0035214215426436

	nan
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
	1.0746598768885853
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
	1.0943919404393814
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
	1.0701129504884461
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
	1.0716229907079045
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
	1.0549713864838552
him think really ill of her.
	1.0147587375180105

	nan
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
	1.0842264793135272
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
	1.057926144583919
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
	1.0836803410018128
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
	1.089528340497586
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
	1.0848605406053724
mile behind.
	0.9954199036470244

	nan
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
	1.0912683268285013
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might
	1.0724096882276704
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
	1.0782865040047507
there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that
	1.0769309850994717
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with
	1.0783734351094043
great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
	1.0534255957470586
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On
	1.1030622637023297
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
	1.1148987901738734
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
	1.0630027576572934
on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies
	1.0910176271923724
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
	1.0450499786320002
slowly towards the house.
	0.9990535258265764

	nan
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
	1.0753347547800036
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.
	1.0644462284467755
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.
	1.072805068192454

	nan
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
	1.0820366600261366
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
	1.088357321108837
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
	0.0
_I_ have seen nothing of it."
	1.0300741178916395

	nan
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
	1.0956514527167287
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
	1.0463920781429663
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."
	0.0

	nan
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
	1.0850592990688857
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are
	1.0562306950456686
perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so
	1.0520388576518853
disagreeable?"
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
	1.071662048097239
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
	1.0605962889693508
seen him so pleasant as this morning.
	1.0080144497439345

	nan
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
	1.0676724990920672
her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
	1.0825200278216638
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
	1.0758428787010437
warn me off his grounds."
	0.9954545934243866

	nan
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
	1.0538293179621234
nothing.
	nan

	nan
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really
	1.077553250333381
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
	1.0778524305538681
any body, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured
	1.0954274075955817
look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
	1.06021784112104
he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
	1.0721555392199293
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure,
	1.0952088005918668
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
	1.0913168928050874
character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a
	1.0478907401976454
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
	1.0667360772076326
comprehends every virtue."
	1.012179660106601

	nan
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
	1.0694847391828284
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
	1.070846664460661
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
	1.0692101502382163
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
	0.0
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
	1.0694615016126818
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
	1.079324300760313
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
	1.061548626183102
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
	1.031267766914802
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
	1.0800780315202756

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
	1.069163316086862
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
	1.0635763008704382
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
	1.0816281308810847
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
	1.0868720570342025
any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
	1.1029795295539446
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
	1.0721848280027955
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
	1.0647285748918485
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.
	1.0246082868297164

	nan
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
	1.0812729260025191
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
	1.0483470478585806
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above
	1.0908215301489026
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.

CHAPTER II.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
	1.0893901721877501
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
	1.0658518049276027
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
	1.0955773623757927
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
	1.079805074574697
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
	1.0650395946313675
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
	1.0609962123215195
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
	1.1013937284282735
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
	1.0881425276846832
curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the
	1.030441629481441
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
	1.0444218052043754
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
	1.07055728094956
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
	0.0
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
	1.08292328822882
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
	1.0967007509033413
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
	1.0757459357734582
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
	1.081614382063935
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
	1.0751999728351653
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
	1.0642086075480304
Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed
	1.0738281183729697
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
	1.0572508285420845
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
	1.0816127007513068
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
	1.0614866198798454
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
	1.0374540710911897

	nan
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
	1.089414824655117
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
	1.0634097616127929
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.
	1.0813420303015666

	nan
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
	1.055908128341609
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
	1.049877833903198
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
	1.0581834564314754
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
	1.0619579937756998
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
	1.0820118564006591
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
	1.070759636492874
her beyond a monosyllable.
	1.009080362965591

	nan
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
	1.082714658203226
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
	1.0572722298197421
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there
	1.0821357893798078
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
	1.0732649291280862
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
	1.0602443852837733
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
	1.065994952619173
relieved by discerning such different feelings.
	1.0214042967963806

	nan
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was
	1.0754053855452799
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
	1.0802412090129365
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step
	1.0687066166305244
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
	1.1012088854765483
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
	1.0771718404826203
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
	1.0374688929797813
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
	1.0386680295353388
again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
	1.0708575233011381
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
	1.0911088522428487
done.
	nan

	nan
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
	1.091782263141302
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
	1.090959825395577
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
	1.0569082466887236
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
	1.068467839567635
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
	1.060618864356158
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
	1.0478736369389021
it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
	1.0906214558089449
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
	1.0498795538307746
evident enough.
	0.0

	nan
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
	1.0905404677176103
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
	1.0687683309144493
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
	1.0638206167230637
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
	1.083542732459701
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
	1.0499767564186233
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
	1.062082459958728

	nan
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
	1.0743395767218182
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
	1.085169466426378
like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
	1.0610793669495795
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
	1.0645574699764204
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though
	1.0854753892817475
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
	1.0622326197824985
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared
	1.1199923791905042
on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between
	1.058296295068873
them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was
	1.091354234623965
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
	1.0382431453303584
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
	1.0360390385881744
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
	1.075349459276923
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a
	1.0917723221880449
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
	1.0770274574799095
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
	1.0835933983902948
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It
	1.0783497589161732
is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when
	1.093037286250908
we were all dancing together at Netherfield."
	1.0300938336179764

	nan
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
	1.0718521001394763
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
	1.0726044337180753
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the
	0.0
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
	1.0711559302058087
which gave them meaning.
	1.008383712702832

	nan
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,
	1.1043305016129186
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
	1.057968097443923
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
	1.0648221381657312
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
	1.0484543615541666
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
	1.060071027639472
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
	1.0733352969331094
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
	1.076229062243191
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
	1.085414751528923
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
	1.0644117586282995
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
	1.0580505700159615
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
	1.0585032045691944
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
	1.0507022478455432
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
	1.0630609904669923
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
	1.0597474326467733
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
	1.0714772161663138
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
	1.031965953648484
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
	1.0498768290194356
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
	1.059214290544174
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
	1.0574830583108794
Rosings.
	nan

	nan
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
	1.0792280871571485
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
	1.0910491696949989
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
	1.0937871734097842
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
	1.0789580136594974
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
	1.0341172523046793
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
	1.0765253527016767
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
	1.0627365829925919
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,
	1.0456587644220996
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
	1.0556596391661999
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
	1.086373038535353
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
	1.0596457340219931
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
	1.0732038542633973

	nan
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
	1.0549987257258624
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
	1.0737440651707544
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
	1.0431624220565694
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
	1.0827608756564528
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
	1.061688853664558
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
	1.036228834319541
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
	1.0615386605778934
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
	1.0862643404741474
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
	1.0541443326321647
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
	1.0458287842527365

	nan
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
	1.123000817764578
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
	1.083884551230475
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
	1.0616491304726043
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
	1.09967594188213
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.
	1.0167205320793316

	nan
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
	1.120544834759236
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
	1.0743105285647871
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
	1.0671791489348292
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
	1.0619540606043258
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
	1.083578900585373
would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
	1.092734504137037
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
	1.0369618849954867
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
	1.0883348997450886
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
	1.0469857379185514
hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
	1.0583525067486372
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They
	1.054684831015872
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
	1.0800724939869055
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
	1.0683735814278918
market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,
	1.0447551112997864
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
	1.0818849921122495

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
	1.083686470697747
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
	1.0769080940042695
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
	1.0671044658450841
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
	1.0554253606483255
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
	1.0264838695319871

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
	1.071384165917164
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
	1.086910537663211
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
	1.058803757574121
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She
	1.0730489838604564
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
	1.0772250505208858
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
	1.0736544952939082
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
	1.0899701709662553
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
	0.9938468383533154
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
	1.0648296042382233
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
	1.0482608084939649
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
	1.0531047873304535
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
	1.064504131966298
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
	1.0683394770350954
overlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once
	1.0559426679445598
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
	1.065890931108892
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
	1.0732009576394486
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been
	1.039270068586742
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
	1.05245717455919
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
	1.0385881417577958
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
	1.0601063701961286
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
	1.0618745933662763
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a
	1.1006289300595797
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
	1.0704503943523431
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
	1.0592412171917633
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
	1.0829354600881613
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she
	1.0655601379592714
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
	1.0691638502694598
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
	1.0748774450444039
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
	1.0766442638139249
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
	1.0826094751747737
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.
	1.0532529870046774

It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
	1.0874246823593994
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
	1.099057274871643
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
	1.0801932472059765
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
	1.0543301227438
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
	1.0455466728729934
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
	1.067577364238381
morning. They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,
	1.0634648697812366
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
	1.0926318964176478

	nan
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
	1.0865823039269873
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
	1.054779483624492
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.

CHAPTER III.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
	1.0828654240521192
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
	1.053674763194518
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
	1.0825028816135494
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
	1.072157813094021
renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
	1.0867472890530943
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
	1.0128686677484826
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
	1.0771068327524573
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
	1.061985011822636
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
	1.035911560547952

	nan
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
	1.0780171738695665
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
	1.1084197592984448
London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
	1.0820340859495372
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
	1.0464869332100117
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
	1.0486841358880332
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and
	1.0744540630594817
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
	1.0457152437395654

	nan
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
	1.0988651693395666
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
	1.073637442574841
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
	1.0812297761998804
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
	1.0305859121193826
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
	1.0739125380287389
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
	1.052934614977319
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
	1.085057996140254
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
	1.069634367082349
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.
	1.0405840793129553

	nan
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
	1.0699235287973952
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
	1.0819849357395195
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
	1.023306011060146
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
	1.0811873882396787
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
	1.0548225930445134
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
	1.0906729884222839
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
	1.0979088769589997
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
	1.0795901838040451
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
	1.0618536302904318
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
	1.0571707468204639
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
	1.0719473382230464
enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
	1.063322608187813
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
	1.0489693108277274

	nan
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
	1.06038873396662
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
	1.0667396595414702
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
	1.0407187422679507
significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
	1.0655415893196891
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
	1.0900419209052055
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
	1.0599152216942564
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
	1.044004844116306
them round the table.
	1.0073155759100916

	nan
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
	1.0643854567623303
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
	1.0904687510399769
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
	1.053057535821978
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
	1.0789467461903062
regret that he came.
	1.0035009816693783

	nan
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
	1.1002763963434572
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
	1.0766586941754748
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
	1.0817771278186812
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
	1.067585660670083
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
	1.0507247469861671
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
	1.0622440998942664
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
	1.0751152048362966
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
	1.0706375264824612
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
	1.0765351492005406
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
	1.0707060762489888
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
	1.0622919226504928
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
	1.069276380387864
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's
	1.1139540259142706
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
	1.053114614439334
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
	1.067680654581835
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
	1.0671085795315478
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
	1.0797695574822395
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,
	1.026785655855925

	nan
"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
	1.066541603558059
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."
	1.0570823029897956

	nan
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
	1.084474226197969
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
	1.0516844686726095
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
	1.0232535555358548
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
	1.0670880046196936
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While
	1.0550161736578776
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
	1.0658160177689115
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
	1.025537109098047
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
	1.076912856799281
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
	1.0445168652136836
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
	1.064989470645489
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
	1.0886243800416868
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
	1.0721209077682878
Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
	1.1004249800395876
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
	1.0489199045162123
corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated
	1.0819668139477054
elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
	1.0541534350237283
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her
	1.053453623136415
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
	1.0457234062377239
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
	1.0548636122733075
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
	1.0800483525226496
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
	1.0663547054992544
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
	1.077748248324082
for the welfare of his friend.
	1.032581194133501

	nan
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
	1.0517899680664013
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
	1.055343788112332
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
	1.0710671619073915
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
	1.0884792310303153
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
	0.0
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
	1.071981413187045
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.
	0.0

	nan
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
	1.0604934357430487
above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
	1.0561682525721396
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
	1.0520947810719476
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join
	1.0769300666237063
her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
	1.0791126034329726
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
	1.0745608545019436
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
	1.0700903172538145
lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
	1.0720719584647258
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
	1.0861437244231404
his sister.
	1.0021333867531224

	nan
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I
	1.0935083367856
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.
	1.0734574008052364
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we
	1.091497311488019
should not have known her again."
	1.0226709302943462

	nan
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
	1.0829582506011857
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
	1.040383480384437
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
	1.0585671939139454
summer.
	nan

	nan
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see
	1.0904667661476246
any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
	1.083331998280174
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants
	1.0718157837523064
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
	1.0375883773947223
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
	1.077444814314859
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
	1.0561633089791387
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
	0.0
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
	1.0677372749418579
without fashion, which is intolerable."
	1.0167330875124425

	nan
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
	1.0716864340335472
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
	1.070407162540233
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
	1.0796772929955423
success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a
	1.047812762206801
determination of making him speak, she continued,
	1.0233220125329328

	nan
"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
	1.0777550065147985
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
	1.0767751443280371
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
	1.0648387700527306
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she
	1.0940673875053708
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
	1.0759685554728424
one time."
	0.9988434043472193

	nan
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
	1.0619044927632506
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have
	1.092255027104142
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."
	1.066074882088

	nan
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
	1.086139828720157
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
	1.0585011153506858

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
	1.0749680656033849
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
	1.0355682549576208
them both. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
	1.0737412098868175
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.
	1.0406628537672664
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
	1.0812366045561332
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner
	1.0566625142777886
thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by
	1.058398197026354
her niece's beginning the subject.

CHAPTER IV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
	1.0770649727435109
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had
	1.0639619858973113
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
	1.075628917456731
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
	1.0792428166888488
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
	1.0841393083481037
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
	1.070013283819261
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
	1.0447478698273827

	nan
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
	1.0881285775038783
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
	1.0543743319296617
themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
	1.0763396026933598
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
	1.0604692864998655
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
	1.0601318422863522
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
	1.0832964479758165
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:
	1.0535387272413363

	nan
     "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
	1.058745154676388
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
	1.0644526996360213
     you--be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to
	1.0908429101971977
     poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
	1.077778446817492
     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
	1.0749643120959924
     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
	1.051139627542786
     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not
	1.072573416963262
     seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a
	1.0758000984528364
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
	1.0758545092630643
     his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I
	1.046955393820439
     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
	1.0581280322058988
     marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,
	1.045917996600628
     for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother
	1.07643870652627
     is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,
	1.083835023071392
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
	1.08123654048693
     forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
	1.0380130502069322
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
	1.0488804323303604
     eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must
	1.0628257403105128
     have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason
	1.060560367188132
     to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
	1.0873609401925703
     informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be
	1.070974956902019
     long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make
	1.0867975741130702
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written."
	1.0496144683993558

	nan
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
	1.043446075551629
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
	1.0543168663821474
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
	1.06521571312509
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
	1.0816718944665358

	nan
     "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
	1.0558766237618111
     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
	1.0440313489077004
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
	0.0
     for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
	1.0706172376893508
     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
	1.0640640870224258
     Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia
	1.0737054741774343
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
	1.0807024086175594
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
	1.085593043125069
     Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
	1.047107750744636
     before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short
	1.0636854675866299
     letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to
	1.0839895002484266
     Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
	1.0584294967372074
     that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
	1.0984863298469034
     was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
	1.0815151834595018
     from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to
	1.0937525033670974
     Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
	1.0602193577621188
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
	1.031178161674675
     from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen
	1.0859943456469523
     to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making
	1.1037500054401446
     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into
	1.0754599501513027
     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
	1.0584125851759907
     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such
	1.0807767681689782
     people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he
	1.0730452845589105
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
	0.0
     most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and
	1.0640265967875282
     Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my
	1.1178792841291425
     dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,
	1.063532200902666
     but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it
	1.081330060219358
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
	1.0535182414757778
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
	0.0
     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,
	1.0641931696032498
     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to
	1.0839468568258497
     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their
	1.0526979259449798
     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
	0.0
     feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill
	1.1093741200489646
     and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but
	1.0870366040681918
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life
	1.099083985838622
     saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
	1.0668415358920151
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
	1.055485501558717
     wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
	1.064103409846674
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
	1.0569923051561902
     is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so
	1.0867545319818714
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I
	1.073612314692642
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
	1.071181625690866
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
	1.0449115474438406
     you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and
	1.0866915934145327
     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
	1.0680122830637164
     still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to
	1.0801024518156808
     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What
	1.0751007368417154
     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
	1.0752811490755425
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
	1.0667008552738955
     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
	1.0576045965121272
     to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and
	1.0814444094479128
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
	1.0356943172017141
     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."
	1.0565613245732803

	nan
"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
	1.0730900518311763
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
	1.0808677820133432
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
	1.0867770378364088
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
	1.077197091953953
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
	1.0322563182954767
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's
	1.0525005029071102
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.
	1.0677578406169672
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
	1.080837833637668
delayed; I have not an instant to lose."
	1.0383778257702487

	nan
"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than
	1.0753922177569084
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,
	1.0284298207041598
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
	1.116690036188969
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."
	1.0298662381937174

	nan
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
	1.0722089052228772
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
	1.0744664057434226
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
	1.0625971886158143
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
	0.0
mistress home, instantly.
	0.9991956911226948

	nan
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
	1.0855929728068554
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
	1.0725480068843696
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
	1.0717724618831457
"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you
	1.0899140536009926
present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very
	0.0
ill."
	nan

	nan
"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There
	1.0705179595923147
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by
	1.1081062212203237
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."
	1.0506650843555836

	nan
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
	1.0918513256125326
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
	1.0616612778082186
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
	1.0483447825476282
silence. At length, she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from
	1.0940587713651717
Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My
	1.1007564590353378
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
	1.0331276959399545
herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together
	1.0887447275491176
from Brighton. _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no
	1.1100540871613103
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
	1.0649905323332858
ever."
	nan

	nan
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added, in a yet
	1.0868994981507776
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew
	1.0541773071890572
what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
	1.104829024803429
I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
	1.0855296730370905
have happened. But it is all, all too late now."
	1.0579631782567247

	nan
"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked. But is it
	1.0702890953021575
certain, absolutely certain?"
	0.9941108012227174

	nan
"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
	1.0732806630043985
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
	1.0539684590789888
Scotland."
	nan

	nan
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"
	1.0733887533770972

	nan
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
	1.1022345294193505
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But
	1.0835333169422277
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
	1.0780362396403496
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
	1.1017766600150782
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"
	1.0605313323012775

	nan
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.
	1.0405825358048346

	nan
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what
	1.094657289504121
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
	1.114034181843915
much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!"
	1.007632359394592

	nan
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
	1.0995742681777676
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
	1.0790569022251884
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power
	1.0551143982910718
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
	1.0691669462855435
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
	1.0639953662177042
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
	1.0555074417876003
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
	1.0767002184824948
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
	1.0758989634497431
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
	1.0132512158025353
him, as now, when all love must be vain.
	1.036887994413217

	nan
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
	1.074069459758669
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
	1.0607259429149736
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
	1.0510730036087663
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
	1.0801751577912442
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
	1.07247824258355
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
	1.0516546248318914
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
	1.0250655820419614
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
	1.0833642979192308
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any
	1.025591858820698
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
	1.052578551885172
consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain
	1.0630112639554794
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This
	0.9991533063138832
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
	1.05791810418835
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."
	1.0361171479713558

	nan
"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
	1.1179746659070289
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
	1.0571388673178728
long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."
	1.0631078520313144

	nan
He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
	1.0670585578070273
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
	1.0601761730601953
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
	0.0
one serious, parting, look, went away.
	1.0167460124621455

	nan
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
	1.0795163390773903
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
	1.06126653631096
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
	1.0521598214731542
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
	1.0651829012390022
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
	1.054763807838784
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
	1.0337108418519414
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
	0.9890706850889316

	nan
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
	1.0608571583366875
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
	1.054042518573623
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
	1.0679661751916476
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
	1.0603786196921012
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
	1.0641879302343384
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
	1.0742019600857111
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
	1.0827659084733794
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
	1.0781380592052519
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go
	1.0560385380866686
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
	1.0807936709006962
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
	1.029193401847326
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
	1.0557259434909652
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
	1.1055619233221263
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
	1.0567356796937555
of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first
	1.0835339243373534
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
	1.0428230886331706
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
	1.0770452095287721
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
	1.0475399185370122
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
	1.0802419353402528
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
	1.0656254855133545
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
	1.0472272840721
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
	1.0577033048396354
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
	1.060585167066494
prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
	1.0630462383892005
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had
	1.0773815881843123
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one
	1.0399926035561893
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
	1.0445844103746758
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually
	1.0548272176344824
fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
	1.074778612604593
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now
	1.0633439461325325
feel it.

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
	1.1170553699234582
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
	1.0957823658583847
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
	1.0712654318983472
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
	0.9949290514685404
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
	1.0737641487662333
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
	1.0716191255429646
was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
	1.0930790305049376
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
	1.0771522971556544
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
	1.0493721757625312
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
	1.0613415389653322
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had
	1.083669856074991
never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
	1.063370815444135
deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
	1.0803014905826704
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily
	1.0658827902045034
promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no
	1.0573274510709845
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
	1.0441231161447901
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
	1.062945183852697
settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be
	1.0923655390349314
done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was
	1.0994387802303816
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"
	1.0325510984451192

	nan
"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
	1.0921086966014153
_That_ is all settled."
	1.0193135012621426

	nan
"That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
	1.0912355512967353
prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
	1.0852243515571403
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"
	1.025663179378487

	nan
But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
	1.0863275490328648
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
	1.060988024175053
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
	1.068628151906603
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
	1.0580906926955087
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
	1.0657832555250935
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their
	1.0734299268259864
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
	1.0598090194308059
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
	1.0545263189608232
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
	1.0690723913553624
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
	1.0818098677089605
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.

"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
	1.076743204183876
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
	1.0681651576225062
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
	1.0734971709203784
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
	1.0832382761632044
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
	1.0716100612833503
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
	1.0762497483766484
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
	1.0692590435540505
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
	1.0688972450350862
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
	1.0572593382773114
not adequate to the risk."
	1.0271870382336037

	nan
"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
	1.0768483470587917

	nan
"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's
	1.0979900016645976
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
	1.064538713117157
interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of
	1.0852801860659078
Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
	1.0856494893329038
him capable of it?"
	0.9926024479722156

	nan
"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect
	1.0812817399988235
I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not
	1.1005863360753905
hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
	1.0758818554253382
case?"
	nan

	nan
"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
	1.0888219059267095
that they are not gone to Scotland."
	1.0366192188094911

	nan
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
	1.0878369215182544
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
	1.0688246909878476
Barnet road."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
	1.0836675667966675
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is
	1.0835334219024881
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
	1.0732539672616668
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
	1.028699784291331
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."
