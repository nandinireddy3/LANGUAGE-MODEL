nan
 why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
	1.0792069333143297
marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular
	0.0
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
	1.059400166796885
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
	1.1011038402583195
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
	1.0432891341861028
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
	0.0
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
	1.074287427826691
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
	1.0699364045992634
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
	1.0421847304671794
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
	1.0846453310073372
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no
	1.0758094975671224
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
	1.058392085462999
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
	1.0580373480093497
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
	1.0799182547124784
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
	1.0772550724818386
such a matter."
	1.0114747372460096

	nan
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
	1.1014048841065345
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"
	1.0781978438609379

	nan
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
	1.069635284096535
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
	1.082589149163034
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
	1.1008356571190876
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
	1.107762994759817
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
	1.0667540946966876
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
	1.0702828543199545
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
	1.1103120218351432
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
	1.0832908161379682
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
	1.0671116121080242
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing
	1.0524070315395866
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
	1.0866051438238944
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
	0.0
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
	1.055541591890783
person and address that can captivate a woman."
	1.0440137783690404

	nan
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
	1.0786907048764784
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."
	1.0566842762200988

	nan
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
	1.0860557124257593
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
	1.0618638362908654
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
	1.0789525674840914
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
	1.0923901403541136
sense of the word. That he has neither integrity nor honour. That he is
	1.0981956194157063
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."
	1.038740226529366

	nan
"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
	1.0766081627842121
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
	1.0631890197812863

	nan
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you the other day,
	1.0835919646515515
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
	1.0863716937319312
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
	1.0782412636854277
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
	1.0683578154927378
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
	1.0553309614632853
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
	1.0663002047327048
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
	1.0757591336751173
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
	1.0662407447501054
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
	1.0671613676619156
her."
	nan

	nan
"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you
	1.0876924336520453
and Jane seem so well to understand?"
	1.0332753656335258

	nan
"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
	1.1204254170863233
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
	1.0897924361131268
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
	1.0802506068974993
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the
	1.1059662765682687
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
	0.0
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
	1.0519957679979004
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
	1.0671574067266973
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it
	1.0434693461842353
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of
	1.0798744122146493
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could
	1.0770252453129037
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
	1.093390956466566
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
	1.0460857724924535
enough from my thoughts."
	1.0040658726591367

	nan
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
	1.0695789422249349
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."
	1.0298737575023196

	nan
"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
	1.0858819004777633
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
	1.0700283558904105
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away. When first
	1.0972297398882513
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
	1.089058361359857
were. Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him
	1.0923793429490032
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
	1.066100874310274
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
	0.0
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
	1.061915384952038
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
	1.0736595355933005
favourites."

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
	1.0691587373129798
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
	1.0652158538470453
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
	1.0597710524490895
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.
	1.1060941417679582
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
	1.0829775632338043
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
	1.0235908964247324

	nan
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
	1.0576398826819609
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a
	1.0913606768429782
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
	0.0
by long expectations.
	1.0067661444819085

	nan
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
	1.0794083933870757
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
	1.0947332467716928
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
	1.0783830163152044
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
	1.0617545285828216
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
	1.0770470433401347

	nan
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
	1.069722098788075
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs
	1.0566121752138877
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.
	1.0457689439088325

	nan
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
	1.0546786186520705
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
	1.0674494876855074
heard of the fugitives.
	1.0092614430509852

	nan
"Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
	1.1004964004881286
every thing will be well."
	1.0145503743844322

	nan
"Is my father in town?"
	1.0167765825828485

	nan
"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."
	1.0586876546905488

	nan
"And have you heard from him often?"
	1.0272588761372996

	nan
"We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
	1.1001708141694053
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
	1.0860511045461119
particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write
	1.0689206748789926
again, till he had something of importance to mention."
	1.0435683254730816

	nan
"And my mother--How is she? How are you all?"
	1.0580767100147435

	nan
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
	1.0760031602285176
shaken. She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
	1.072593203083895
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
	1.0942755187237219
Heaven! are quite well."
	1.015076473416645

	nan
"But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you
	1.0927579571086268
must have gone through!"
	1.0004078810739043

	nan
Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
	1.0694524565275325
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
	1.0615205144279294
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
	1.079304187021272
the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
	1.0923928497900464
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
	1.0400094152839032

	nan
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
	1.0788813857427946
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
	1.0784482351785434
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,
	1.0756089248403649
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
	1.0460025002872215
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
	1.0770367271066061
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
	1.0670118817253567
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.
	1.0577114634167912

	nan
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
	1.0806209239817761
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
	1.0201730838634568
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
	1.0399733558801505
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
	0.0
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
	1.0581397504426775
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.
	1.036558627666574

	nan
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton,
	1.0971024171716213
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
	1.0732833512033793
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
	1.1093935866696676
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
	1.0850931639528747
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
	1.1005113415636116
been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have
	1.0770328463796037
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear
	1.1045400650112793
child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
	1.045513395756143
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
	1.074818287511721
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
	1.0965272606646532
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
	1.099168314321749
we shall do."
	1.0031227819980049

	nan
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
	1.0761197960482551
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
	1.059148361312272
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
	1.096952193630922
Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
	1.0587422749728703

	nan
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
	1.0930127764427735
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
	1.076981270475977
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we
	1.113653783814364
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
	1.0367609937560796
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
	1.093737982580064
lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
	1.1066759280401306
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
	1.062541399387653
together as to what is to be done."
	1.0380028851318062

	nan
"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I
	1.0819231960260547
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
	1.0921867334647872
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
	1.0335138203754914
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
	1.0846502986357354
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
	1.0599255263704137
after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from
	1.0667444606003897
fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened
	1.097970550460489
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
	1.0667868723930916
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
	1.0837317986082848
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear
	1.1033160253644714
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
	1.08379291470206
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,
	1.0655184236164672
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."
	1.0482962803189757

	nan
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
	1.0795347280455503
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
	1.0771029122346925
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
	1.0767908676452729
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
	1.0616680945891044
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.
	1.0270056110251178

	nan
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
	1.068825150288782
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
	1.0731733253394546
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
	1.0644610659511415
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
	1.0547811763874972
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
	1.076799717180856
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
	1.0506007620054199
subject.
	nan

	nan
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
	1.1005806993079295
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
	1.0359594732738622
appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her
	1.0645228806898086
toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
	1.0627030823681753
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
	1.0764285731896144
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
	1.0752525525103975
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty. As
	1.0734940565693774
for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth
	1.0667156767598096
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
	1.0687042151821353
table,
	nan

	nan
"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.
	1.0887825668197542
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
	1.1083781258896332
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."
	1.0364110856017514

	nan
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
	1.0591537025279754
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
	1.1016014863245018
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
	1.0656587242744588
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
	0.0
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
	1.0776931805050878
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."
	1.0637926701572114

	nan
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
	1.0756093097262664
make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
	1.0614291488020169
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
	1.0468319762711238

	nan
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
	1.1058968907940416
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
	1.0470710297345331
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
	1.0543440673466267
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
	1.0510031050464435
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
	1.068760738239032
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
	1.0628613574514632
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which
	1.089515797924429
I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel
	1.082144170095668
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
	1.0670056763289624
took place? They must have seen them together for ever."
	1.0460986551528106

	nan
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
	1.0602588627109222
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
	0.0
grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
	1.0921256497010148
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
	1.0895220817448446
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
	1.0670876876324304
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."
	1.0278150373470254

	nan
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
	1.0774232918754294
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"
	1.0561680524314874

	nan
"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
	1.0706156682437686
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
	1.0800603934486894
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
	1.053486299081194
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."
	1.036511031275298

	nan
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
	1.0687577790224547
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"
	1.033130625177198

	nan
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a
	1.0957693222833529
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
	1.077250846244594
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
	0.0
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
	1.0731148971214763
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
	1.068827539911135
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last
	1.0800617046532222
letter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems,
	1.0838133393709373
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."
	1.0577130524811778

	nan
"But not before they went to Brighton?"
	1.026806918406283

	nan
"No, I believe not."
	1.0187731008210443

	nan
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he
	1.0840670965289312
know his real character?"
	1.0021148695085653

	nan
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
	1.088973569490326
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
	1.0985551871268164
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in
	1.0611634354675128
debt; but I hope this may be false."
	1.0282261398740933

	nan
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
	1.0955343591301532
this could not have happened!"
	1.010501387739053

	nan
"Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister. "But to expose
	1.0782428202139744
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
	1.0680492122346656
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."
	1.057635572033704

	nan
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
	1.0792371318867364
wife?"
	nan

	nan
"He brought it with him for us to see."
	1.0521330377988474

	nan
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
	1.0884385022614746
were the contents:
	0.9993136738197596

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
	1.0785007229041461
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
	1.0269280642973804
     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
	1.0828787843640666
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
	1.083051794824319
     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without
	1.0894242632497437
     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at
	1.0982697707059694
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
	1.0850284443977785
     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
	1.0546325483857724
     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for
	1.0891550591181198
     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my
	1.0312835600173405
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will
	1.072757613959941
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
	1.0467937724661722
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my
	1.0878421173503143
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
	1.0483428085748163
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
	1.079388840154936
     packed up. Good bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
	1.1006944534390428
     will drink to our good journey.

     "Your affectionate friend,

     "LYDIA BENNET."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had
	1.0423850991046504
finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment. But
	1.085010610195262
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.
	1.0928741126631811
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
	1.0803811947114401
_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"
	1.0581618196824714

	nan
"I never saw any one so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
	1.1070383977649478
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
	1.0785173703803634
such confusion!"
	nan

	nan
"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
	1.074654762464731
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"
	1.0725212640866912

	nan
"I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is
	1.1289666936453735
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
	1.0816159754572503
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
	1.0929453026707017
as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen,
	1.0756065886495971
almost took from me my faculties."
	1.0162113559363064

	nan
"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you. You do not look
	1.094060378727404
well. Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
	1.096760662989055
upon yourself alone."
	1.0012630510217326

	nan
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
	1.0791179164277576
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.
	1.0762490473287643
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
	1.0845921096267983
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
	1.099512565061616
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
	1.0890083131498203
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
	1.1032279220950874
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
	1.072962952124874
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
	1.064483440635977
they could be of use to us."
	1.0203841591687604

	nan
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
	1.0623568198251507
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
	1.0454588388394361
little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,
	1.0561034227316766
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."
	1.087817542476021

	nan
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
	1.0711545946673906
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
	1.062766126744071

	nan
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
	1.087427335897014
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
	1.0584583853479668
be made out from them. His principal object must be, to discover the
	1.0774445378166921
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
	1.0711765472171826
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
	1.0815711841676732
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
	1.052032243334498
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how
	1.0867283953669786
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
	1.0636585025842573
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
	1.059038878177032
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
	1.1230240848882596
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
	1.0914217461663112
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
	1.0704634477012103
out even so much as this."

CHAPTER VI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
	1.0987307133292228
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
	1.0773521926171008
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
	1.0870763776042236
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.
	1.0533393808484794
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
	1.0704909751217802
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
	1.0827463999563345
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
	1.070248673623059

	nan
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
	1.0651442093774346
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
	1.0369820960856042
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
	1.1093896986389498
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
	1.0658495363400633
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.
	1.0641317159145518

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
	1.0899854799574324
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
	1.0693872487777787
her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
	1.0933027325878664
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
	1.04703969520423
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
	1.0586466257982254
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
	1.0482219951610294
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
	1.0600420444160232
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
	1.0604827253887716
them.
	nan

	nan
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
	1.0811008024693933
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
	1.0874403797071788
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
	1.0785990485656327
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
	1.0833670830018223
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
	1.0826222284457696
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
	1.0748335839458494
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
	1.0547372365816574
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
	1.073494678401777
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
	1.0750036352222627
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
	1.0634649979172024
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
	1.0668345003810078
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
	1.0381893409985796
news of them.
	1.0014677921743596

	nan
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
	1.0854133324610793
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
	1.05380574662333
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.
	1.0543919407385094
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
	1.0942351123157377
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
	1.037814225113141
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
	1.0849532210780068
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
	1.0529922134382026
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
	1.058898338198295
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
	1.0709303811427526
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.
	1.0960049683637973
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and
	1.0571100665581754
promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
	1.0842093331633667
effect.
	nan

	nan
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
	1.0816188325702478
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
	1.068172947248907
whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
	0.0
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there
	1.08229497412955
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
	1.073344655762922
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we
	1.0960880997689393
have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every
	1.0731669414682612
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts,
	1.0776789253186492
perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
	1.0504010493636233
than any other person."
	1.0031450058246907

	nan
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
	1.07407247542979
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
	1.0697203564840825
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.
	1.0335906910175925

	nan
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
	1.0839800111419045
mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however,
	1.0788361043263637
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
	1.0899688692542036
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
	1.03988577677731
application was a something to look forward to.
	1.0361643339998672

	nan
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
	1.0899498966263752
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was
	1.0906565370574717
the first grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,
	1.0804676841037932
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
	1.0783620796104325
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
	1.0486963895299124

	nan
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
	1.0775281591354247
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
	1.0741294187586463
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
	1.0691986086611982
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
	1.0482876685493374
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
	1.0640938609693082
follows:
	nan

	nan
     "MY DEAR SIR,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
     "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
	1.0561018374478102
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
	1.0800131902877625
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
	1.0452200619013507
     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and
	1.076898043836335
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
	1.0406351317534044
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
	1.051374466851169
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No
	1.0574151258759714
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
	0.0
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
	1.05661128050078
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death
	1.0915872103935067
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
	1.080728002564462
     And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
	1.085624177950593
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
	1.0340411994176693
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
	1.0615929286482988
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
	1.067645852892031
     yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
	1.07462801250266
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
	1.0522187474684273
     such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you
	1.0853396829327313
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
	1.066796291072236
     by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,
	1.073113943049371
     to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in
	1.0881728905379706
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
	1.0555462570727872
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady

     Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
	1.0311260001160647
     with such a family. And this consideration leads me moreover to
	1.0755579995127276
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
	0.0
     November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
	1.073331508732585
     all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
	1.0688872898480775
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
	1.06627628145171
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
	1.0004027588620168
     fruits of her own heinous offence.

Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
	1.0807522707726438
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
	1.0846908664812192
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
	1.0852886902985845
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.
	1.0770311366388192
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
	1.0800290953614446
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
	1.0612587858355325
with any of them. There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
	1.093488523633135
as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own
	1.1114106830471826
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
	1.071933098749373
his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
	1.071758518576014
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
	1.0680783857962406
amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
	0.0
be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton. He owed a good deal in
	1.0899631452637937
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr.
	1.0891855993270674
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
	1.060002853061159
family; Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is
	1.0835371029297582
wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."
	1.0500594916627317

	nan
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
	1.0866781093931004
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
	1.0656134951907539
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
	1.070775211816606
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
	1.0771014210498613
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
	1.0601144341947961
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
	1.0934145707358827
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
	1.0496047314123749
what her anxiety for his life had been before.
	1.043948769513378

	nan
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried. "Sure he
	1.0873787171216194
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
	1.0788144501940333
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"
	1.043421301787359

	nan
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
	1.1079997460784965
and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
	1.1030193359067564
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
	0.0
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
	1.038750492560451

	nan
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
	1.0867975254199116
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
	1.0798406485799223
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
	1.06732046859097
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of
	1.0840234381136833
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
	1.0739880547116667
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
	1.0585897409263731
Pemberley.
	nan

	nan
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
	1.0668396548448036
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
	1.0611105470796556
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
	1.0501429108710096
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
	1.0514143564171838
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
	1.0888177983894123
Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
	1.0777571326135176
one sleepless night out of two.
	1.0282567766238273

	nan
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
	1.0842215222889189
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
	1.0821388930290408
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
	1.065974535643913
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
	1.0616392201714586
it.
	nan

	nan
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
	1.0783072876065296
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
	1.066646522359631
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
	1.0400366373594727
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
	1.0821952051084578
and I ought to feel it."
	1.0350456454174306

	nan
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.
	1.0572191364982515

	nan
"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
	1.0969706656592801
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
	1.055936568218447
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
	1.0940270170703739
It will pass away soon enough."
	1.0295643991712546

	nan
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"
	1.0359661852673467

	nan
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"
	1.0416839651784149

	nan
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.
	1.0774303537989038

	nan
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
	1.0666178812441367
will probably be of some duration."
	1.0100336531796414

	nan
Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no
	1.0725186272063207
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
	1.0527618039470408
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."

	nan
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
	1.0810286647365668
tea.
	nan

	nan
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
	1.0802759672331959
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
	1.0811894926513057
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
	1.0849696077906112
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."
	1.0817578128100132

	nan
"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_
	1.0769770451129126
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."
	1.0596607315395985

	nan
"_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
	1.0915782226672484
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
	1.0829567357648384
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house
	1.0925695710692969
again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
	1.0709755267550674
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
	1.0852471566089454
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
	1.0578626380186442
minutes of every day in a rational manner."
	1.0442901891856848

	nan
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
	1.0867817140825182

	nan
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
	1.0895733935821812
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
	1.1106098278136243

CHAPTER VII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
	1.0930695750253328
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
	1.0574005515176352
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
	1.0515526777340278
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
	1.0572510993576845
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
	1.067633220571969
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
	1.0610413458223595
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."
	1.0767095890521436

	nan
"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."
	1.0659665489423469

	nan
"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
	1.0744472242243197
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
	1.0948747387402762
this half hour, and master has had a letter."
	1.0513211785003138

	nan
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
	1.1080350417112415
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
	1.0247882433358353
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
	1.063231607887707
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
	1.0527380733825948
butler, who said,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
	1.0759978187348613
little copse."
	1.001787794356831

	nan
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
	1.0620824005390905
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
	1.0577340147736625
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
	1.0700831162449644

	nan
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
	1.0912358107008238
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
	1.0510586933101111
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,
	0.0

	nan
"Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?"
	1.0645609960406985

	nan
"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."
	1.0656661547350503

	nan
"Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?"
	1.050507645946637

	nan
"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from
	1.0893924054810955
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."
	1.048334156133348

	nan
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
	1.0802480129340508

	nan
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
	1.0852401289694775
about."

     "Gracechurch-street, Monday,

     "MY DEAR BROTHER,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
     "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
	1.0906556000384244
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after
	1.0753073170589518
     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
	1.0706851865670401
     part of London they were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet.
	1.0805314215174366
     It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
	1.0699011124617492
     both----"
	nan

	nan
"Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"
	1.070846352631979

	nan
     Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both. They are not married,
	1.0776527455791203
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
	1.076563844797263
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
	0.0
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is
	1.0851541443737325
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
	1.068838869583246
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
	1.0441649904824475
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
	1.0408373948325969
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
	1.0593937777782845
     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions, which,
	1.0436326314671978
     considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
	0.0
     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
	1.0468207802762504
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
	1.0618065353622692
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
	1.0437856764825324
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
	1.034879424964557
     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
	1.0871943686198193
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
	0.0
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
	1.0756534045768231
     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
	1.0879016360808011
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
	1.064127539814649
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
	1.0257991654622562
     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
	1.0616489628490677
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
	1.0634214226048613
     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,
	1.0856787083257036
     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best, that my
	1.0851616221841498
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
	1.059228023158557
     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as any
	1.0983457618824004
     thing more is determined on. Your's, &c.

"Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. "Can it be
	1.0760821505331393
possible that he will marry her?"
	1.0118635490878813

	nan
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
	1.0736829016591785
sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."
	1.0386786180984988

	nan
"And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.
	1.0460362700734016

	nan
"No; but it must be done soon."
	1.038503388828439

	nan
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
	1.0867611696760124
wrote.
	nan

	nan
"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.
	1.0648861390830808
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."
	1.0634330903837643

"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
	1.063578753483493
yourself."

	nan
"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."
	1.0748245625804487

	nan
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
	1.0800336607003178

	nan
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
	1.0848267755030967
complied with."
	0.9944432514273887

	nan
"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
	1.0703856480595713

	nan
"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"
	1.053074184044225

	nan
"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
	1.1056500104145386
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
	1.0914441046786112
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am
	1.0860810552037765
ever to pay him."
	1.0042424927512994

	nan
"Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"
	1.0498422737596629

	nan
"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
	1.0941909633642617
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
	1.0610097380725065
gone."
	nan

	nan
"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
	1.0799522596736624
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
	1.071998199855804
it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
	1.0864673127119133
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."
	1.0571923682020967

	nan
"No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
	1.0846572079374688
farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so
	1.0879943808800725
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."
	1.0490926841330452

	nan
"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
	1.086854302361585
repaid?"
	nan

	nan
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
	1.0869425198421867
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the
	1.0671791353137012
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
	1.0695341489023371

	nan
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
	1.0713799960950219
were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
	1.0966789600431823
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
	1.0645390473908987
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!"
	1.072721028189135

	nan
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
	1.0620261318176625
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
	1.0955961219567172
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
	1.043982816223428
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has
	1.0718527523216281
children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten
	1.0808632630141615
thousand pounds?"

"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said
	1.086453440370133
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
	1.087030188694182
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
	1.0652609396842836
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
	1.0982132643336135
requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
	1.0635730286479164
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
	1.056239925545198
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
	1.0512619249058002
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
	1.0537661271078362
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
	1.0824229933384897
first sees my aunt!"
	1.0019154691590937

	nan
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
	1.07674069829225
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry
	1.0945602044239762
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
	1.1057860166841695
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
	1.0623483339982274
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
	1.0712801121870654
time make their past imprudence forgotten."
	1.0110615056873358

	nan
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
	1.062643319253758
I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."
	1.1008777120710511

	nan
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
	1.084984001348376
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
	1.0459058964842525
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
	1.0467815572283223
make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head,
	1.0763658538669953
coolly replied,
	nan

	nan
"Just as you please."
	1.0142708938362621

	nan
"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"
	1.0636325779441245

	nan
"Take whatever you like, and get away."
	1.0355869437952654

	nan
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
	1.0741087119965327
stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one
	1.0760544618973091
communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation
	1.0636964735723247
for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly
	1.0873076210609927
contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
	1.1005156742084292
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
	1.0473608111487553
added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from
	0.0
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know
	1.0682894715921776
that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no
	1.0841793039056091
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
	1.0565785725383754

	nan
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will
	1.0683818223081045
be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My
	1.0740579891981665
good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
	1.0660807485796924
every thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
	1.1078129401625116
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
	1.05319639059179
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
	1.0761018185788536
much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
	1.086676967925413
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
	1.1170515189599708
Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"
	1.053387153276205

	nan
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
	1.080050324226464
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
	1.0451348975502504
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.
	1.0395945851509172

	nan
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
	1.0686693458548806
measure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
	1.071600243943672
to assist Mr. Wickham with money."
	1.0441123160282055

	nan
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
	1.0875445040019622
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
	1.103108588827429
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
	1.0908108835581287
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.
	1.0902604534288192
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
	1.1078052012502135
it sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
	1.1099955358328868
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you
	1.1072853355647179
write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
	1.0636629038712728
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."
	1.0378479422693294

	nan
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
	1.0758715827268117
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
	1.0674061039368228
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
	1.0744055730835618
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay she observed,
	1.0814806357884172
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
	1.081319915159506
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.
	1.0798637069133974

	nan
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
	1.0995677390859115
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on
	1.098028826087766
Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An
	1.1151380493507363
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any
	1.1192080915387157
thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you
	1.075822703011026
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
	1.0817329989605788
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."
	1.0749489384219424

	nan
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
	1.0839049926225675
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
	1.0523274338477364
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
	1.0721755455217215

	nan
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
	1.0949448607397705
worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
	1.0803920833005622
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
	1.0305479882654545
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
	1.0678502593089656
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
	1.0862111228241589
had gained.

CHAPTER VIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
	1.0877736861003318
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
	0.0
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
	1.083165044176993
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
	1.0974659478166517
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
	1.0780083920199937
honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
	1.0428077565898253
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
	1.0790714186523112
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.
	1.0516204427352809

	nan
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
	1.0818000709960374
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
	1.080876486238119
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
	1.0685993940166383
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
	1.0460644315013625

	nan
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
	1.0826480293078036
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join
	1.0772674592038767
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
	1.0971706106085866
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
	1.0770027980232146
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
	1.0962641487150873
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
	1.0825794660012336
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
	1.0933263509229338
late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
	1.0875083666722707
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
	1.051631837777205
income.
	nan

	nan
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
	1.0818579804464137
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
	1.0839060079057536
latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
	1.082120452029064
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
	1.0833100874432355
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
	1.079623355613553
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
	1.0544460542387957
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
	1.012380617635515
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
	1.0725269011926648
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
	1.0762101378293476
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
	1.0792424386616035
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
	1.0603813040313705
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
	1.0733087841083375
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
	1.0761250678854635
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
	1.053288507050153
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within
	0.0
that sum.
	1.0049407964594788

	nan
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
	1.0883511452580177
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
	1.054941578794999
have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first
	1.0673337881147629
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
	1.0375681456659152
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was
	1.0382856300887946
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
	1.0347224972624063
quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he
	1.074317080476135
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
	1.084937609221571
message to her.
	1.0019387852911337

	nan
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
	1.065394184571342
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
	1.0855170777531096
philosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
	1.0763017297054374
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
	1.0596106818082356
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
	1.0498430695457752
house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
	1.0859735194846036
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
	1.0449150828835712
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
	1.0815376932713638
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
	1.0580934748453636
misery was considered certain.
	1.0101196890342254

	nan
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
	1.1007487201590467
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
	1.0609549470227246
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
	1.0772538117654675
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
	1.0834569205065105
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
	1.0634789589776
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
	1.0444914797467735
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
	1.048404558828289
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
	1.0502040293632582
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
	1.023181941177145
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
	1.0513575670515805
importance.
	nan

	nan
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
	1.0965469132606134
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
	1.0617830310261334
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
	1.0802803463394712
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."
	1.039079477535875

	nan
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
	1.0651481623661885
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.
	1.0504195114298915
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
	1.082623289572659
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
	1.0817259384921327
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage
	1.0292702306468378
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."
	1.0578947789067277

	nan
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it
	1.0811287715636633
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
	1.0674251789930507
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
	1.0834327678454805
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
	1.0755117591027339
affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
	0.0
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
	1.0815941430735931
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
	1.0616343804123196
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
	0.0
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
	1.0867334544226634
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
	1.040023295624704
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they
	1.0663545460171244
took place.
	0.9977732590812776

	nan
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
	1.07944002134759
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
	1.095168773335564
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
	1.0632783570049464
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
	1.0250885634541451
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
	1.0212889465683264
spot.
	nan

	nan
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were
	1.088263859877557
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
	1.0529471958816714
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
	1.0946138689902094
frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of
	1.0871629980209148
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
	1.0489591407727845
seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been
	1.0681811571443995
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
	1.0647141663365665
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
	1.0811197381051736
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
	1.0517103117745088
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.
	1.0539356826785673

	nan
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The
	1.0892340600919204
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
	1.0524841695840652
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
	1.042293052373423
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
	1.0890287411603599
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
	1.07435233234934
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
	1.067290334936896
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
	1.0678465836225857
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
	1.0825758774139258
should meet.
	0.9986233883750609

	nan
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
	1.0824635670625344
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
	1.0576918166931182
have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
	1.05246718366081
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,
	1.088279766347158
there must be a triumph.
	1.0173257357799166

	nan
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
	1.0803684028221259
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
	1.0527680092102276
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
	0.0
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
	1.0970078275732937
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
	1.0549399258986507
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
	1.0779973060201027
have received benefit of greater importance.
	1.0093935149941506

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
	1.0759082355414948
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
	1.0731146894822339
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
	1.089454057507878
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
	1.066973636441862
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
	1.0685845523942088
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
	1.0651916812344366
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's
	1.1038171582270315
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
	1.0314475993254208
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
	1.0552883006258802
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
	1.0825300294606395
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved
	1.0715217516966788
on quitting the Militia.
	1.0177849806604358

	nan
     "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
	1.0804064927659465
     as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,
	1.0872036189493985
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
	1.0543555977132668
     on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go
	1.114677747713943
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
	1.0371130119604155
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the
	1.0918084662027547
     promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in
	1.0508141670615267
     the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
	1.111226599345768
     the kingdom. He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
	1.0774206768613075
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
	1.03776442836283
     more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
	1.0757373479408987
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
	1.0183031179293174
     various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with
	1.0506764015520225
     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And
	1.0463827815697877
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
	1.0396825937245524
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
	1.0773843918302244
     according to his information. He has given in all his debts; I hope
	1.075743001943882
     at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and
	1.069955581305213
     all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
	1.0754210908586717
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
	1.0495112695528952
     Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
	1.0823220457629656
     before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully
	1.0848581654474292
     remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.

     "E. GARDINER."

	nan
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
	1.095190717456479
from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs.
	1.0914300245894493
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the
	1.0982469557913677
North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
	1.0688651197710353
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
	1.0835034716568503
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
	1.0604447103808587
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
	0.0
with every body, and had so many favourites.
	1.0478254436105168

	nan
"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
	1.0979495477621322
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
	1.0989442087929322
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
	1.0731172833665712
regiment."
	nan

	nan
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
	1.0693798522595908
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
	1.047630271220107
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who
	1.0400296242521405
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
	1.0452158060675836
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
	1.061477005908722
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
	1.0562145194096666
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
	1.0799823728567186
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
	1.0679042429586885
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
	1.0761181042711252
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
	1.061285590509019
the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
	1.1023878024289344
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
	1.0551425140917639
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth
	1.069763809954844
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
	1.0567614424616452
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
	1.070684069728942
would have been the last object of her wishes.

CHAPTER IX.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
	1.081383945219418
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet
	1.0515011786082598
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time. Their
	1.069255622957268
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,
	1.0657683873723156
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
	1.0569605057613416
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
	1.0799205933145228
endure.
	nan

	nan
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
	1.083500030703268
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
	1.107612644305566
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
	1.056975581207816
anxious, uneasy.
	0.999750720260006

	nan
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
	1.0953257733349948
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
	1.0882156730393195
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
	1.057929186836157
Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
	1.0655485133395857
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
	1.0329467130283696

	nan
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
	1.0851059897234403
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
	1.0683859922977479
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
	1.0616157820630936
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
	1.0728680055166107
shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
	1.0507950986336485
fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
	1.0593300405564892
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
	1.050360183297412
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
	1.0634898889608633
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
	0.0
there.
	nan

	nan
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
	1.0670991805545407
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
	1.0510034087545266
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
	1.0504541738487996
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
	1.041755051719881
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
	1.0696362239202917
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
	0.0
of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
	1.094862903123968
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.
	1.0763704302446138

	nan
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
	1.0873863327837325
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
	1.0648222087529107
Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
	1.0452255935747297
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
	1.0845297582713935
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
	1.0967068462931766
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
	1.0814090520594972
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
	1.0526856259030701
the world.
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away;
	1.0778953318772335
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
	1.0736676404222136
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
	1.083369824759474
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
	1.097745028448548
thought it would be very good fun if I was."
	1.038479466053976

	nan
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
	1.0791869140302301
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
	1.039547764032903
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the
	1.0646100891823165
people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might
	1.073676673679514
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
	1.0691964661110307
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
	1.0825302404166446
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
	1.0754402299354224
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
	1.0956405438547945
any thing."
	1.002456459806367

	nan
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
	1.1069631159475084
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
	1.0785319630935595
the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
	1.0885264655128892
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
	1.0834039356329812
her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
	1.0812761611071848
lower, because I am a married woman."
	1.0157075584416606

	nan
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
	1.0749144864750353
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
	1.089620053967339
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all
	1.084632579071031
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham," by
	1.0624361933021835
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
	1.0878022641953955
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
	1.0915879326469962

	nan
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
	1.065901715691308
room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
	1.0841486205134954
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my
	1.0857921299741828
good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
	1.0991695028487414
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."
	1.0833015327248074

	nan
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't
	1.1192781730820307
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"
	1.0863688715845752

	nan
"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
	1.0931737066897405
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
	1.0577346770314635
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
	1.0892657099133136
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."
	1.0689396966250007

	nan
"I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.
	1.0619633084830122

	nan
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
	1.0799843601028705
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
	1.0668712640900067
winter is over."
	0.998524105016028

	nan
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
	1.094791474779063
particularly like your way of getting husbands."
	1.0224257017876761

	nan
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
	1.094298114552201
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
	1.0663172216873564
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
	1.0461916244775538

	nan
No one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
	1.0954626695479164
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
	1.0933282764801375
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
	1.0592917313428776
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
	1.0860492485093762
think, than such as did not.
	1.0222227394026608

	nan
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
	1.0713321247121932
find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her
	1.0686103339163886
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
	0.0
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
	1.0686845075945408
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
	1.0552593989833592
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
	1.089522189067613
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
	1.0586525779370588
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
	1.0988075162196989
of having a companion.
	1.0149066683759849

	nan
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
	1.0854524151258655
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
	1.090008976863744
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
	1.0749637402146455
the first of September, than any body else in the country.
	1.081084981891601

	nan
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
	1.0725711218717437
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,
	0.0

	nan
"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
	1.0936661964726038
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you
	1.1041395652552457
curious to hear how it was managed?"
	1.0224639822764419

	nan
"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said
	1.0751131574543724
on the subject."
	1.0118943806437772

	nan
"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
	1.10738489782059
married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
	1.0835767474740412
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
	1.091932125738332
o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
	1.0468989530619657
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
	1.1039521709462108
such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
	1.0951181174838767
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my
	1.0824431114942055
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
	1.0699062348804058
she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten,
	1.0972355146191664
for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to
	1.089058390148497
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.
	1.0358531026087914

	nan
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
	1.0901509625334536
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
	1.0794207382680225
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe
	1.082510154458563
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
	1.081801985486863
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was
	1.0923320966755956
rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just
	0.0
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
	1.0895030245702442
to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get
	1.1049667242161276
together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not
	1.0952036062387405
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
	1.0959435194927216
the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back
	1.0930952453377047
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I
	1.073884501186292
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
	0.0
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."
	1.091275183884442

	nan
"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
	1.052066299040669

	nan
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me!
	1.0920854829119149
I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
	1.1018572424485509
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
	1.0812694987317708

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
	1.081106958941378
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
	1.0427030443493146

"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
	1.0593420795743596
ask you no questions."
	1.0013341396100408

	nan
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
	1.0731191523411001
all, and then Wickham would be angry."
	1.0321415890646917

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
	1.0904255754410646
power, by running away.
	1.0034729728478942

	nan
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
	1.098700737011938
was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her
	1.0909948650534185
sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
	1.0723778763325493
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
	1.0593547166163153
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
	1.0801203109412019
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
	1.0612910640735906
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
	1.0544388087062957
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
	1.0683312900667394
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
	1.041619901638582
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
	1.081392171424044
intended.
	nan

	nan
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
	1.06486210104555
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
	1.0548335031777498
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
	1.0677464694175767
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
	1.0799679390836883
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
	1.0832162653323552
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
	1.0508721103817849
ignorance."
	nan

	nan
"Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
	1.0811803255215227
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
	1.061892371619866
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
	1.0646670012261785
out."
	nan

	nan
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
	1.0831989570787814
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
	1.0659151628730412
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
	1.0421184721655177
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
	1.0791115937695224
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than
	1.0777672435371024
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
	1.0538263008738233
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
	1.0745286585288523
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not

     "MY DEAR NIECE,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
     "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
	1.059842769827808
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
	1.0596731425535177
     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself
	1.0735403406734267
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.
	1.0243865582700686
     Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
	1.0862342007630004
     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
	1.0735408065505778
     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
	1.0477016613371943
     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
	1.0582803738282311
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
	1.0730401935999871
     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and
	1.0764722860018872
     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming
	1.0876341297598415
     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.
	1.0670054567645848
     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all
	1.0850452625293794
     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
	1.0194329532533186
     as _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that
	1.1051619854007073
     he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that
	1.082979109340326
     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
	1.057141830247931
     once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
	1.057967642880915
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
	1.0460120579153551
     for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being
	1.0640270389557607
     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
	0.0
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
	1.0589895846961637
     to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his
	1.0923969373552187
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
	1.0408840608351588
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character
	1.07037796257059
     was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step
	1.0872896997317172
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
	1.0646844612831938
     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
	1.077427001175922
     disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to
	1.0737167296401366
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
	1.0510698107227976
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
	1.0530720034633068
     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a
	0.0
     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
	1.0917999218849102
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
	1.045724416014529
     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,
	1.0863562379838678
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.
	1.0735711357143707
     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
	1.0549097466714137
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But
	1.0601162248977671
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
	1.072804718475397
     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
	1.0459317273799138
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
	1.076851611819092
     found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
	1.068477195598888
     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
	1.0810345711559892
     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our
	1.0706190443892913
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----
	1.049720950305318
     street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.
	1.0512001562223954
     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
	1.0627294404834324
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
	1.0620209946611259
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
	1.0500656890620914
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia
	1.0641310488278164
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none
	1.0543652245651995
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
	1.0855278739203416
     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
	1.0751336070809883
     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her
	1.072122761135653
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
	1.039535288931151
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
	0.0
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself
	1.0502422776959193
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
	1.0441348805301385
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
	1.053912864589971
     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone. He
	1.0670745517594782
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
	1.0400134567037531
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go
	1.0560983267367847
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
	1.0607517919156333
     nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your
	1.0875318497214772
     sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
	1.0837040975877648
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
	1.0713399965172665
     must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to
	1.0669836610549208
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
	1.0533418613803371
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.
	1.0463648479278405
     Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
	1.0589892523231121
     against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,
	1.0591603649210128
     for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more
	1.074209586594763
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.
	1.0579806267259062
     Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was
	1.0793213573925835
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
	1.0695265605708615
     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner
	1.0858465823997399
     could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
	1.0729987533611338
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
	1.064115618177976
     morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
	1.0840404277227438
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
	1.0514622287664483
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not
	1.0785415148136681
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
	1.0733874240419528
     gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your
	1.04876756825665
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
	1.0714125228179496
     had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and
	1.083217062351513
     then _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon
	0.0
     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor
	1.0899706650683723
     was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
	1.0745832967545792
     defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many
	1.0632601560459096
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was
	1.06636914957089
     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
	1.0947912357908447
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
	1.0627934927353506
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it
	1.0498105967550553
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
	1.0529123042527315
     or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced
	1.0822080708657964
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
	1.0877010562352472
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
	1.0786895954911668
     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
	1.059517642381513
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
	1.0380672054995843
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
	1.0529149811927923
     the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
	1.0918799914551824
     than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,
	1.061117760333735
     what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,
	1.093708128921587
     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
	1.058160623433221
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
	1.0542325275025328
     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him
	1.0753716360774686
     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his
	1.084737680871087
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character
	1.0413220159409098
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
	1.048086220969299
     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in
	1.0490393884295766
     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
	1.044864396151425
     reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this
	1.0667388648660088
     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
	1.0111925600788616
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
	1.0637947280806488
     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved
	1.0710757611840678
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
	1.0661988282393293
     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
	1.0717680340919953
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
	1.063653785108147
     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.
	1.0718267075772985
     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
	1.0875131338853803
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to
	1.0547366447529813
     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was
	1.0328911342865303
     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
	1.0613238803503628
     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
	1.0600963404352406
     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
	1.0791354113693328
     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
	1.0604508641720707
     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no
	1.0696349823198583
     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
	1.040611680499389
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
	1.0437041945649064
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,
	1.0838411455021253
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
	1.0921318620254135
     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
	1.0437538795235113
     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was
	1.0985288570310872
     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
	1.0488804295245127
     wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
	1.0953415129771307
     on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear
	1.0864399631625634
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
	1.0818264144490528
     enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
	1.0802353679841257
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
	1.0713691213263588
     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
	1.0586774655458224
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
	1.0592181009973363
     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
	1.0423381111914267
     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive
	1.066775256796942
     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
	1.0741164518043929
     far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I
	1.0661907451316377
     have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
	1.0793599945140289
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more.
	1.0877552615100727

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
	1.0755672630858593
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
	1.0631305309456205
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
	1.0487409738438818
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
	1.0776994158091975
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
	1.055689746732841
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
	1.0823691452003603
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
	1.043077004110315
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
	1.0802279134410264
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
	1.0401721709825353
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
	1.0751503314250146
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
	1.0559623339994395
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
	1.0626679650940052
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
	1.0884706078761024
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
	1.0858652587190218
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her. But it was a hope
	1.084921098563602
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
	1.0521107164165586
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
	1.019132728862913
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
	1.075343477622063
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.
	1.0433903884805975
Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the
	1.0813503712688306
connection. He had to be sure done much. She was ashamed to think how
	1.1037357055161716
much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
	1.070400293123952
extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel
	0.0
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
	1.0770916824539472
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
	1.0579349128482871
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
	1.0491333661320799
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
	0.0
materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
	1.0228646182436378
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
	1.052141310096776
return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
	0.0
to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
	1.0784365012774404
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
	1.061716875949245
towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.
	1.0718528701009806
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
	1.0946950489596967
the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him
	1.088237659868267
again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even
	1.0920828342814521
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
	1.0610166372200287
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
	1.054825328298671
confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.
	1.033717208921337

	nan
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
	1.0799972980529309
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
	1.0531397383328522
overtaken by Wickham.
	1.0114839177870092

	nan
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he,
	1.0748090455145232
as he joined her.
	1.009588708624934

	nan
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
	1.0803033427144542
that the interruption must be unwelcome."
	1.037796272338453

	nan
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends;
	1.0879985573161568
and now we are better."
	1.0256325288754555

	nan
"True. Are the others coming out?"
	1.0388726611032824

	nan
"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
	1.108563576922539
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that
	1.092904229685497
you have actually seen Pemberley."
	1.0102228044545356

	nan
She replied in the affirmative.
	1.0288001501669353

	nan
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
	1.0969576682859594
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
	1.1094507916148948
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
	1.0461104745837022
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."
	1.0697673811293789

	nan
"Yes, she did."
	1.0115381925800468

	nan
"And what did she say?"
	1.0173975893915206

	nan
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
	1.0886093994830608
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
	1.0689172728991774
misrepresented."
	nan

	nan
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
	1.0659537723458719
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,
	1.027251586787955

	nan
"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
	1.0954646107830845
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."
	1.0505186114550835

	nan
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
	1.0538607306777263
Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this
	1.081681740321794
time of year."
	0.9990817048884432

	nan
"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
	1.0812767919060053
understood from the Gardiners that you had."
	1.005236933259482

	nan
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."
	1.03942114771573

	nan
"And do you like her?"
	1.0144282713454975

	nan
"Very much."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
	1.0692048949938457
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
	1.1174754012451933
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."
	1.0599328352555366

	nan
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."
	1.0867233542570842

	nan
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"
	1.0392682577312808

	nan
"I do not recollect that we did."
	1.0371437962553989

	nan
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
	1.105115224371426
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
	1.04054939768075
me in every respect."
	1.0008287453955176

	nan
"How should you have liked making sermons?"
	1.0295039784302409

	nan
"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
	1.085497336509405
the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
	1.073842702186783
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
	1.075687483265339
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
	1.0811136070973504
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
	1.0970828582230274
circumstance, when you were in Kent?"
	1.000166708037693

	nan
"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
	1.0734486845467839
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."
	1.0568203599380073

	nan
"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
	1.0899014067809556
first, you may remember."
	1.005439054700504

	nan
"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
	1.0915760815983937
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
	1.0725686312376044
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
	1.0578836239772313
had been compromised accordingly."
	1.0168065239307995

	nan
"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
	1.0758981691220406
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."
	1.0712721250007187

	nan
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
	1.1045221775326715
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
	1.0953290399460904
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,
	1.053680925153005

	nan
"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us
	1.1010100423763685
quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
	1.0859014910904985
mind."
	nan

	nan
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
	1.063031115377857
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.

CHAPTER XI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
	1.0746475475036785
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
	1.0031934880591586
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
	1.0911990425679803
had said enough to keep him quiet.
	1.0362556142942976

	nan
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
	1.0965241391710356
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
	1.0697523729719352
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
	1.0508243729641245
continue at least a twelvemonth.
	0.0

	nan
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"
	1.058575633479867

	nan
"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years perhaps."
	1.0978992191093626

	nan
"Write to me very often, my dear."
	1.0402394394555108

	nan
"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
	1.0949745616268116
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
	1.072059615842463
do."
	nan

	nan
Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He
	1.097733912370395
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
	1.0292960439567673

	nan
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
	1.1093221454823947
the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
	1.1083670331257074
all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
	1.0852240040518442
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."
	1.035797048719376

	nan
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
	1.0976564335174541

	nan
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
	1.0882875254438276
one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."
	1.0586591357579853

	nan
"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
	1.0750116076067804
Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
	1.0775483850783658
single."
	nan

	nan
"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
	1.0965347178917189
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
	1.0894111139425608
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."
	1.0677746634432725

	nan
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
	1.0694168125071704
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
	1.0631449110557805
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation. The
	1.0635991541904688
housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
	1.0309147925191202
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
	1.0767496076755314
there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She
	1.092371432098039
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.
	1.060875438928393

	nan
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.
	1.0901033753287266
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better. Not that
	1.1019349377229728
I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
	1.1123500603115477
_I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to
	1.0916389425601691
come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
	1.0772472238252189
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
	1.104126777620403
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
	1.080532695809129

	nan
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in
	1.0916345090626485
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
	1.0877009817468315
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
	1.1135241607881832
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
	1.0762202866203054
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
	1.0902180826868269
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
	1.0796957158788039
killed."
	nan

	nan
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
	1.0798400702064488
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
	1.0669583836441705
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,
	1.0633769044095867

	nan
"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
	1.107976819275135
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from
	1.0913409332794388
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt
	1.085839695077191
that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you, that the news does not
	1.106138962931291
affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he
	1.080428810451026
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid
	1.0859743564860416
of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."
	1.0554207214227

	nan
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
	1.102332550287874
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
	1.0645680108906515
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
	1.0537869257881267
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
	1.0890764993848427
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
	1.066371222406969
without it.
	0.9999531825458733

	nan
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
	1.081026211898764
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
	1.07085874647523
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."
	1.0402811547439492

	nan
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
	1.0787936979846773
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
	1.0416610730107099
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
	1.0669515848287907
more unequal, than she had often seen them.
	1.039314783225196

	nan
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
	1.0589993166991625
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
	1.0451575801045603

	nan
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you
	1.0929806778753257
will wait on him of course."
	1.0083933209604694

	nan
"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
	1.098741450481935
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
	1.0637511038333778
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."
	1.073813332263705

	nan
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
	1.06111611953793
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
	1.0622471323957436
Netherfield.
	nan

	nan
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let
	1.0856199818276555
him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in
	1.0942974067124565
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
	1.0410256922704988
again."
	nan

	nan
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
	1.0896629593528506
wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
	1.0488003765992489
here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.
	1.105230171766664
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
	1.0732539246291368
table for him."
	0.981504406844401

	nan
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
	1.0748878510507256
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
	1.064225256735835
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
	1.0636600018409774
did. As the day of his arrival drew near,
	1.058710777458065

	nan
"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It
	1.1108319631079924
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
	1.0670383436939062
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
	1.0708080336661063
but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she
	1.0927457522470845
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"
	1.050691140207833

	nan
"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
	1.0761530646331896
it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual
	1.0867227309227152
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
	1.0654510060085893
you have always so much."
	1.0073509344953637

	nan
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
	1.0896268485534184
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
	1.0725445593607879
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could. She counted
	1.083583901344758
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
	1.063760264850314
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
	1.074310412726863
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
	1.0496672340968325
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
	1.0726648736429656
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
	1.0694725534620575
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
	1.1050542090711681
again by her sister.
	1.0098751097374394

	nan
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"
	1.0779689082534871

	nan
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
	1.0861781014819718
know."
	nan

	nan
"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
	1.0817992301843917
him before. Mr. what's his name. That tall, proud man."
	1.0787896497326086

	nan
"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does I vow. Well, any friend of
	1.1085199987132843
Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must
	1.1070801484660475
say that I hate the very sight of him."
	0.0

	nan
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
	1.081659838284057
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
	1.0619061531208802
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
	1.073855594147615
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
	1.0405878010547613
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
	1.0797985099588447
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
	1.0873190374764856
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
	0.0
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
	1.0732616927985914
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
	1.0756777392979158
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
	1.0878436213190663
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
	1.083194814177872
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
	1.0373129934773195
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
	1.0444076019864086
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
	1.0743283992111528
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
	1.057117665882361
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
	1.07002876772272
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
	1.0475463147268087
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
	1.0756015526612548
behaviour in Derbyshire.
	1.0045674244362577

	nan
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
	1.0737975070425847
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
	1.0589668919710575
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
	1.0736139117477745
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.
	1.0075624373976417

	nan
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
	1.0757209856109144
enough for expectation."
	0.9986329600374003

	nan
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
	1.074958331344305
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
	1.0726232393200412
sister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
	1.0762404977135909
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
	1.078305532387126
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
	1.0528103053599724
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
	1.052438291682393
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.
	1.0288689304164684

	nan
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
	1.077686919804926
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
	1.0831963128113675
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and
	1.0817523807046916
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
	1.0835434457664168
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
	1.095865031464561
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
	1.079308776644188
not an improbable, conjecture.
	1.0140892944924897

	nan
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
	1.0767500981244698
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
	1.0812300326906457
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
	1.0710953387757987
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
	0.0
her curtsey and address to his friend.
	1.0336181706245267

	nan
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
	1.0731851330933333
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
	1.0477991579167163
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
	1.07218986060814
applied.
	nan

	nan
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
	1.097740826982808
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.
	1.0587969839232005
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
	1.0872684708699296
but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her
	1.0867591369771588
friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed,
	1.0622765497148172
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
	1.0543607795844583
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
	1.0947418551502528
as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
	1.077920171540838
object but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
	1.0733795145440497
than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed,
	1.0469187649504264
and angry with herself for being so.
	1.0395164161441008

	nan
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"
	1.0986809970249904

	nan
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
	1.0865370651187776
him she had hardly courage to speak.
	1.023438783728921

	nan
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.
	1.061377313980536

	nan
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.
	1.1149285860559996

	nan
He readily agreed to it.
	1.0235613866333615

	nan
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,
	1.0892378774715166
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
	1.0695272295399867
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
	1.08246850340401
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
	1.0547825638326518
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
	1.0724947795643767
seen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;
	1.095030869644358
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,
	1.0818916804452752
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
	1.0809968930954512
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.
	1.0739786769775137
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
	1.1067452554263062
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"
	1.0592823390881259

	nan
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
	1.0629340929532414
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
	1.0979463282841586
not tell.
	1.0011509172513617

	nan
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
	1.0917876122898122
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
	1.0872855545938864
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
	1.1034494608546657
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
	1.0644149778431444
stay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you
	1.063579467570648
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
	1.0771835731669557
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
	1.0618339102132948
many as he deserves."
	1.011345346310552

	nan
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
	1.097442414521469
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
	1.0898938168608023
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
	1.0478606299044926
done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
	1.082511101880157
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
	1.06198948641078

	nan
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother,
	1.0868156847720487
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.
	1.0936170033343298
Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
	1.1017259530464327
will save all the best of the covies for you."
	1.0496524876683273

	nan
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
	1.0477786586910227
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
	0.0
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
	1.0460304896200525
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,
	1.06937195120824
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
	1.0716426440476898
moments of such painful confusion.
	1.0115513609834281

	nan
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
	1.0982809831662879
in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure,
	1.074264033200092
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
	1.0764969354109446
one or the other again!"
	1.0129987345636513

	nan
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
	1.0770860065404404
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
	1.038580577640139
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
	1.075242837852015
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
	1.0867151885479127
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
	1.09030989213805
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
	1.0732844407527193
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
	1.0609917465954213
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
	1.0276080235463545
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
	1.0913092704076042
that she did not always know when she was silent.
	1.060689792241591

	nan
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
	1.0957001099416093
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
	1.0397229308898053
Longbourn in a few days time.
	1.0337789524411345

	nan
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when
	1.0984703733127124
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
	1.0705913341721853
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
	1.0325746363354915
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
	1.0703671399749437
your engagement."
	1.002600623040811

	nan
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
	1.0732677197920593
his concern, at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
	1.078866299006296

	nan
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
	1.0911015554526424
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
	1.082699974172721
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
	1.0799678902692793
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
	1.0719668900666908
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.

CHAPTER XII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
	1.073765173736454
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
	1.066033271728417
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.
	1.0897409531057207

	nan
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
	1.076313283461103
"did he come at all?"
	1.0119906900183437

	nan
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
	1.0674118943837287

	nan
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
	1.0761310138237703
he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
	1.094370873187639
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will
	1.0714207637565374
think no more about him."
	1.0174517314053222

	nan
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
	1.0695048626683137
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
	1.0772731348231939
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
	1.022947253467097

	nan
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
	1.0744774628440523
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
	1.0793666888812201
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
	1.1060722237812206
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
	1.0514508005172651
acquaintance."
	nan

	nan
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane,
	1.060970816394999
take care."
	0.9939933155347259

	nan
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."
	1.0946278702992647

	nan
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
	1.100197794129902
you as ever."

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
	1.093265918320759
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
	1.0855275182942934
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
	1.0601530376883903
revived.
	nan

	nan
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,
	1.0834568889989245
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
	1.061516240973797
sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
	1.0699197495189698
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
	1.0449954741534317
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
	1.076417052529735
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
	1.0817055938488764
invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
	1.0742244901183924
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
	1.075493962913801
decided. He placed himself by her.
	1.0308653419692086

	nan
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He
	1.0651966210867478
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
	1.0478347252600895
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
	1.0870887838336472
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
	1.0527640190579268
alarm.
	nan

	nan
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
	1.0752549211806697
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
	1.0241974863102665
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
	1.0718640729670068
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
	1.0713632982519599
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
	1.0526092188099
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
	1.0692721096040652
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
	1.0839429797910436
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
	1.1070535470752352
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
	1.0788300473287182
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
	1.077760841306223
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
	1.0749170614120616
cold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,
	1.0339376889716687
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
	1.076716706366228
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
	1.0847826588944953
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
	1.060130942839715
the family.
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
	1.0745613911943812
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
	1.0623616387671417
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
	1.0610587950419754
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and
	1.0551969754451276
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
	1.0597573045991273
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
	1.055344374681329
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
	1.0869946582587686
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
	1.0531953374379628

	nan
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
	1.0963628760145612
ever."
	nan

	nan
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
	1.0709898746215933
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
	1.0640957660598052
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
	1.0596477911639925
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
	1.0839991271556233
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
	1.0980194645558246
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,
	1.0846250808506355

	nan
"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
	1.1085131870982035
do we?"
	nan

	nan
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
	1.1039089807429177
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
	1.062002385192704
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
	1.061281846822613
for being so silly!
	1.0066750330415561

	nan
"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
	1.088996836865592
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
	1.0823108758138684
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
	1.0850352456801888
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"
	1.0529131934225424

	nan
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
	1.0790673138750109
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,
	1.0280299318803259

	nan
"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"
	1.0252194389217564

	nan
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
	1.0390219754371077

	nan
"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
	1.0472811724521256

	nan
"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
	1.1022743488549889
these three weeks."
	0.9926098829359241

	nan
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
	1.0819206644554478
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
	1.0819110184081924
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
	1.076998436003326
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
	1.0303224116923126

	nan
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
	1.083642804594176
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
	1.0765470142437898
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
	1.0678411658722768
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
	1.074970941634926
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
	1.1056018126373668
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
	1.0705107131961384
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
	1.0661050515455384
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
	1.0797010942008896

	nan
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
	1.08141844049239
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
	1.0510696141352491
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
	1.0366021714945108

	nan
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
	1.0711903962558298
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
	0.0
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
	1.1073641786287696
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
	1.0896267596780858
a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
	1.0932092179462494
Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
	1.0838733178775333
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
	1.0744444712819503
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
	1.094679644525913
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
	1.0965416708579512
what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
	1.0826189909895638
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
	1.1266434567581063
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
	1.071335084213772
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
	1.0528381847719368

	nan
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
	1.0983776762619222
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
	1.0921979568823563
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
	1.0687892768762448
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
	1.0386400568267447
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
	1.0773382538685703

	nan
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The
	1.0964803994816468
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
	1.0882519560370143
may often meet again."
	0.9964180894501101

	nan
Elizabeth smiled.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I
	1.1200712238985595
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
	1.0717404422960397
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
	1.0758019516926136
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
	1.0425909316324418
design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with
	0.0
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
	0.0
pleasing than any other man."
	1.006260437996686

	nan
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
	1.0783441496677015
are provoking me to it every moment."
	1.0318140216571836

	nan
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
	1.0584009882665657

	nan
"And how impossible in others!"
	1.0161021825987544

	nan
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
	1.0770257636057523
acknowledge?"
	nan

	nan
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
	1.104613386064123
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
	1.0745288344711694
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
	1.046047744486875
confidante."
	nan

CHAPTER XIII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
	1.097716765210477
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
	1.0675648947157914
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
	1.0889483594759302
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
	1.0868121725048296
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
	1.0270437961552843

	nan
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."
	1.0766347135840677

	nan
He should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
	1.1023775677699184
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
	1.0641948689939276

	nan
"Can you come to-morrow?"
	1.0152416521561363

	nan
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
	1.0848947710804508
accepted with alacrity.
	0.9734964969292963

	nan
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
	1.0984863224127037
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
	1.1037716773697888
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,
	1.0421766253862041

	nan
"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
	1.1055604634061724
come.--He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
	1.1074856303371086
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
	1.088591507764291
Lizzy's hair."
	1.0120159653125875

	nan
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
	1.0969383513228523
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."
	1.0922013537922555

	nan
"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
	1.0999319648198065
where is your sash my dear?"
	1.0106928405183735

	nan
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
	1.0947922402506352
without one of her sisters.
	1.0177867339724727

	nan
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
	1.0820633612035442
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
	1.0879273751971963
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the
	1.0849936595159364
five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
	1.0656514574632012
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
	1.0558017995039506
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
	1.063033914493812
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do
	1.087838746462788
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"
	1.0486312598033387

	nan
"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five
	1.0975970945566962
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
	1.059061556025369
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,
	1.008272150019042

	nan
"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.
	1.1138230976108412
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
	1.070622332326029
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.
	1.0807074305938629
In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,
	1.0958197711710416

	nan
"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
	1.0559670898366733

	nan
Elizabeth was forced to go.
	1.0262143279633773

	nan
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
	1.0800958117996282
soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
	1.0984044787482872
my dressing-room."
	1.0085993886389557

	nan
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
	1.065941501775089
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
	1.0747121144347718
into the drawing-room.
	0.9942950262746549

	nan
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
	1.0943440695570987
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
	1.0621673187744858
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
	0.0
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
	1.060157818629429
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
	1.0661172360722626
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.
	1.0404381247494172

	nan
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
	1.0664742359019603
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
	1.0415495620682484
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
	1.0895856047245178

	nan
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
	1.0992287148732403
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
	1.0612564902450978
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
	1.078677828588985
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
	1.051810649828266
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
	1.057733702831336
concurrence.
	nan

	nan
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
	1.0933145859455886
morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
	1.0593313895737186
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
	1.0452340339066941
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
	1.0646339948597714
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
	1.0397726673062835
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
	1.0783719468013484
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
	1.1038687181957978
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
	1.0752662476577677
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
	1.0838248194929503
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
	1.102103715058208
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.
	1.0149044639718467

	nan
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
	1.0902193019791957
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
	1.0745974477776814
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
	1.0871661100879777
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
	1.0671758504452418
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
	1.0687355890870491
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
	1.05937526173321
have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
	1.0667047615221976
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
	1.0561292674858858
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
	1.0831009186878953
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
	1.0756940769764736
words to her sister, ran out of the room.
	1.0475645346255622

	nan
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
	1.0636400738260974
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
	1.0374567671766124
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
	1.0594254807026493

	nan
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
	1.109653327898832
why is not every body as happy?"
	1.0212101174362154

	nan
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
	1.0662605839200339
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
	1.0412151558138445
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
	1.0711022989985748
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
	1.0533382470923502
said, for the present.
	1.0106177123130573

	nan
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any
	1.0946808501358032
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
	1.0429136796652678
from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
	1.110597274713147
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
	1.0880619571649954
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"
	1.0307508175770521

	nan
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
	1.0749240881708537
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
	1.0249929695649935

	nan
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
	1.078879743746612
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
	1.0725552605799016
previous months of suspense and vexation.
	1.0140488868327173

	nan
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
	1.0870546926743037
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
	1.0460244070702716
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"
	0.9966380611859753

	nan
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
	1.0826410431981734
father had been short and to the purpose.
	1.043419387053563

	nan
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.
	1.077277934551144

	nan
"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say."
	1.1119626095447186

	nan
He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
	1.0990197831893715
affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
	0.0
delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
	1.058064704511545
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
	1.047364965361266
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
	1.0973053115156743
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
	1.0818331863232211
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
	1.0480409998950588
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
	1.0539128497978967
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
	1.069146211081352
himself.
	nan

	nan
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
	1.0928783577429446
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
	1.1036399855649859
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
	1.0612467473535105
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or
	1.08244470514576
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
	1.0444998438161235
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
	1.069435751892716
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
	1.079294382654955
how really happy he was.
	1.013559440077312

	nan
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
	1.0800457758033943
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
	1.0648407625456522
turned to his daughter and said,
	1.0201314096574448

	nan
"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."
	1.0794036685450594

	nan
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
	1.0653701982283763
goodness.
	nan

	nan
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in

thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
	1.0752401856782678
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
	0.0
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
	1.0638044401599005
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
	1.0625436879253245
always exceed your income."

unpardonable in _me_."

"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
	1.0851564704928633
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
	1.0608611015245901
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
	1.0802126079765946
happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
	1.1040268899945167
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
	1.120812873018123
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
	1.0820116293345294
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
	1.0721666602620503
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
	1.0900889128246347
ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
	1.0660508442127263
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
	1.082449973194492
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
	1.0618749926395041
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
	1.0828392383632952
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
	1.0616474500099886

	nan
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
	1.0717866311716295
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
	1.021232763574458
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
	1.0498510939483092
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
	1.055084003444227
himself obliged to accept.
	0.9879834833851964

	nan
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
	1.0686415101704347
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
	1.0736769582110663
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
	1.068154794042234
hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane,
	1.069362547378838
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
	1.0608357044196854
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
	1.0836211053484965
relief.
	nan

	nan
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
	1.0825142623264028
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not
	1.0772070901076556
believed it possible."
	0.9829678340529595

	nan
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for
	1.074284636913523
it?"
	nan

	nan
"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to
	1.0954546382194805
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
	1.073202191961062
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
	1.0766083493951413
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
	1.078858472681868
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
	1.0800028680326008
can never be what we once were to each other."
	1.0414019879545098

	nan
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
	1.0723493783997595
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
	1.0847532107971187
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."
	1.0580880682017686

	nan
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
	1.0714354786753268
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
	1.0639567408314305
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"
	1.0229508004622319

	nan
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
	1.1105695898900385
modesty."
	nan

	nan
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
	1.0668907743955842
the little value he put on his own good qualities.
	1.064735222810808

	nan
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
	1.0672644733310577
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
	1.0728104889835912
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
	1.070638499059068
her against him.
	1.0058631029349436

	nan
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
	1.059373852469442
Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
	1.0864327657230157
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
	1.0698871333951734
such another man for you!"
	1.016238331734357

	nan
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
	1.096968944523787
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
	1.0792883088652379
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
	1.0825907749826527
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."
	1.0677305056075057

	nan
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
	1.0776793411488514
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and
	1.0913212975003728
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
	1.0740354120018947
neighbours in Meryton.
	1.001784941870109

	nan
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
	1.0792707592090334
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
	1.0677464839173205
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.

CHAPTER XIV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
	1.0819973400554355
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
	1.0806268256599454
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
	1.0545707669304858
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
	1.0696732038224201
lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
	0.0
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
	1.0856659523608778
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
	1.0770853078463258
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
	1.0761042544643524
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
	0.0
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
	1.081810132429885
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
	1.0724727614781473
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
	1.050141602611893
open, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.
	1.0542758859126744

	nan
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
	1.0631122820601582
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
	1.0403844058718008
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
	1.0660814121183346
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
	1.0118318356280378

	nan
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
	1.083042448953423
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
	1.0649523959340745
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
	1.0695932147418932
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
	1.0615683204846402
introduction had been made.
	1.015703464923122

	nan
Mrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
	1.0826728977409985
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
	1.0399400487593091
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
	1.066270702974221

	nan
"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother."
	1.1045639353008558

	nan
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
	1.041989747211878

	nan
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."
	1.0595888976899102

	nan
"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.
	1.0923281850571949
"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is lately married,
	1.0987308581763113
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
	1.0829793479264223
who I believe will soon become a part of the family."
	1.062374155313827

	nan
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
	1.0826341606395968
silence.
	nan

	nan
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
	1.0878194198436002
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."
	1.0657553245391689

	nan
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
	1.0741427299914947
summer; the windows are full west."
	1.034235943188528

	nan
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
	1.0826706905306864
added,
	nan

	nan
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
	1.09478143740045
Mrs. Collins well."
	1.020622289384306

	nan
"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."
	1.0791398910266137

	nan
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
	1.0726636230554916
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
	1.08899726758522
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
	1.0230722231227558

	nan
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
	1.0733125318585877
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
	1.0388857460219605
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,
	1.0413325808682046

	nan
"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
	1.0837955944955942
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
	1.1284034900934519
will favour me with your company."
	1.013223637097798

	nan
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
	1.0658205351721035
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."
	1.0671036451379206

	nan
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
	1.0641979963373727
attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall,
	1.0558046825080083
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
	1.0678082430014872
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
	1.061690052929554
looking rooms, walked on.
	1.0049467680522104

	nan
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
	1.066316319450913
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
	1.0814381514242102
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
	1.0901484483114363
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
	1.055225109234553
disagreeable.
	nan

	nan
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in
	1.0929810014514965
her face.
	1.001863189880847

	nan
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
	1.0784622733281872
manner:--
	nan

	nan
"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
	1.0933101809654724
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
	1.0762745333537074
come."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
	1.0258169426341248

	nan
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
	1.0878345095243058
for the honour of seeing you here."
	1.038454951357863

	nan
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
	1.0701073946337576
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
	1.0868696933781525
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
	1.0719394487587766
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
	0.0
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
	1.0950724183291018
alarming nature, reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
	0.0
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
	1.0642022565991043
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
	1.057649795797056
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
	1.0707262141358065
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
	1.067943344940271
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
	1.0885565843848874
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
	1.0598695281706
you."
	nan

	nan
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
	1.0588776127144095
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
	1.0711951639012334
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"
	1.051625121567067

	nan
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."
	1.0721750971955135

	nan
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
	1.0703359570161133
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
	1.0590388146262093
is in existence."
	1.0087192292064537

	nan
"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
	1.0809157606836077
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
	1.0623140159401834
report is spread abroad?"
	1.0051500854076543

	nan
"I never heard that it was."
	1.0289297487216706

	nan
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"
	1.0670020443187096

	nan
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _You_
	1.0788079735687095
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."
	1.0325440723465442

	nan
"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
	1.1081764179101181
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"
	1.0459824278435141

	nan
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."
	1.045637883236245

	nan
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
	1.1047909257075696
reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
	0.0
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
	1.0800922835257925
may have drawn him in."
	0.997766991955634

	nan
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."
	1.083768221555488

	nan
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
	1.0882492872160343
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
	1.080674659186062
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."
	1.0545093644445762

	nan
"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
	1.0727803612980635
this, ever induce me to be explicit."
	1.02418286052115

	nan
"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
	1.0696658749691008
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
	1.0853129376889603
engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?"
	1.0514620888525432

	nan
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
	1.102775406625243
make an offer to me."
	1.0150410537467593

	nan
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,
	1.0497419974277566

	nan
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
	1.0780532007192958
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
	1.0673198069405272
_his_ mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned
	1.091758609947567
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
	1.0999240249535525
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
	1.0719490955510718
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
	1.0541726512884837
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
	1.1056634849119478
tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
	1.0830557567272974
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his
	1.051069015460091
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"
	1.0190755513939058

	nan
"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
	1.120575963417292
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
	1.0623532118151633
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
	1.0733473664384745
Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the
	1.0936156960301209
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by
	0.0
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
	1.030141951804732
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
	1.0614871286511596

	nan
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss
	1.053990289741516
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
	1.074073852672935
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
	1.070329438668824
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.
	1.0626401847937483
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
	1.0771360196661122
by any of us."
	1.0171742635986645

	nan
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr.
	1.0850914493190513
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
	1.0466841388956352
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
	1.0729469246013832
to repine."
	1.0054348241103839

	nan
"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
	1.0676769552066288
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
	1.079657155013665
score?
	nan

	nan
"Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
	1.0935009710452845
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
	1.0738743452148203
dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.
	1.1143556809722859
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."
	1.0671528971292934

	nan
"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
	1.0603039373385672
but it will have no effect on _me_."
	1.0382768053374845

	nan
"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
	1.0954231070903648
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended on the maternal
	0.0
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
	1.0657676744087825
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both
	1.0505012764321495
sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
	1.0795540097078267
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The
	1.0802218647642483
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
	1.0585876953738038
fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
	1.1100757729076485
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
	1.0780031323494321
in which you have been brought up."
	1.0292855507835768

	nan
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
	1.0686576626818693
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
	1.086880414582552
equal."
	nan

	nan
"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who
	1.0990886516045681
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
	1.0666937173094266
condition."
	nan

	nan
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
	1.0614322217394976
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."
	1.0567946427458261

	nan
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"
	1.0481363411687485

	nan
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
	1.0703312844059418
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
	1.0652755138208374
moment's deliberation,
	0.9990660553673265

	nan
"I am not."
	1.0089144873819909

	nan
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
	1.0200005274175798

	nan
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"
	1.0657283028383404

	nan
"I will make no promise of the kind."
	1.0490528856527155

	nan
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
	1.0891733239221995
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
	1.0822859652051446
will ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the
	1.0676361237009122
assurance I require."
	0.0

	nan
"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
	1.0916318287845
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
	1.073862237339902
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
	1.0655688240453762
_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to
	1.0504794315968426
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
	1.067713738551212
on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
	1.0803067017387875
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
	1.0383011931718271
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
	1.0465103381443734
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
	1.058530997138254
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
	1.0680818089115722
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
	1.0713443921380572
mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
	1.0766394827942707
subject."
	nan

	nan
"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
	1.1162931254253816
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no
	1.082993129952843
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
	1.0528396846292702
elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
	1.0850220805654267
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
	1.0894024084131817
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of
	1.111247537757793
his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what
	1.083682705495877
are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"
	1.068618414154758

	nan
"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.
	1.066969178344799
"You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to
	1.0951701854311247
the house."
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
	1.0889702351999797
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.
	1.0374496849270987

	nan
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
	1.0790553179180202
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
	1.0717654074010088
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"
	1.0314323541985457

	nan
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments."
	1.088493179222107

	nan
"You are then resolved to have him?"
	1.0295840387450086

	nan
"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
	1.1047467348050148
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
	1.044783977154343
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."
	1.053547840859942

	nan
"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
	1.1113902342546769
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
	1.070819268145635
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."
	1.1061431050420294

	nan
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
	1.0479043959839291
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either,
	1.0750159953997436
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
	1.1050993359304169
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
	1.0844028387234845
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
	1.072880035429372
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
	1.0771308844615248
the scorn."
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I
	1.1003718664995048
shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
	1.085539310872786
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
	1.109529340874523
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."
	1.050958033912428

	nan
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
	1.0893651178369468
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,
	1.0426503475098097

	nan
"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
	1.1005792467452917
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."
	1.081829211255932

	nan
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
	1.0589970003233244
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
	1.07263085035953
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
	1.0710449751630549
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
	1.0873908462356745
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
	1.054183134749411

	nan
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."
	1.0672992857790617

	nan
"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
	1.0828491402484544
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
	0.0
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
	1.0755087979993363
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
	1.0844125435164806
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"
	1.003557240921873

	nan
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
	1.0776630286918887
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

CHAPTER XV.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
	1.0457650658641071
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
	1.0561205346774838
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine it
	1.0649319382826754
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
	1.0577884686114571
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
	1.079139659211209
Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of
	1.1107130642547962
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
	1.0525020149868922
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
	1.0565321783031745
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
	1.0913211080620027
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
	1.0625879522333517
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
	1.1029077102804805
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at
	1.055627967234088
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
	1.0455717908732722
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only
	1.0687026396634034
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
	1.0570048764794435
forward to as possible, at some future time.
	1.0428959744660349

	nan
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
	1.068647167110379
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
	1.042998231969154
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
	1.0754115098261645
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
	1.0406508123994809
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
	1.0582626996028583
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
	1.0739307783814303
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
	1.0909983453897232
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
	1.0575726241236896
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
	1.0823484038349005
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
	1.0707053383877385
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
	1.0561730903652815
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
	1.077247390748845
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
	0.0
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
	1.05407300523283

	nan
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
	1.088320666392473
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
	1.0611656030335135
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
	1.0748585155510506
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
	1.0884584186627873
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
	1.0691644628670065
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
	1.0580942537516866

	nan
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
	1.0684500381999091
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to
	1.0709323810725018
understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
	1.062467789405156
his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
	1.0867726686842618
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
	1.0560583497930494
at all."
	1.0002275686981978

	nan
       *       *       *       *       *
	nan

	nan
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
	1.0887261640813874
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
	1.0586823010468425
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
	1.0611040033837875
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.
	1.0587247147728625

	nan
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
	1.0850814661587749
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
	1.0736935691621794

	nan
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."
	1.0922989700549905

	nan
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
	1.0830170258880605
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
	1.071115321750341
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might
	1.068582383283158
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
	1.058982073659915
consequent explanations.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
	1.0953206817165477
then said,
	nan

	nan
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
	1.0620496009452096
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
	1.0447039494877752
contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
	1.0734269650142572
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."
	1.0775947899527523

	nan
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
	1.0681155482156877
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
	1.073266549703628
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
	1.0686268904022573
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
	1.0522433189493987
herself; when her father continued,
	1.0048372567641277

	nan
"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
	1.0683130495245314
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
	1.0817406682489825
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."
	1.064130664756733

	nan
"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"
	1.0620119858114145

	nan
"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
	1.0820067321104776
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
	1.0504388200413173
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
	1.0818561275227656
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
	1.0867662759784715
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. "Having thus
	1.0870641435265844
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
	1.0673467745371168
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
	1.086562091026406
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
	1.0835289047146712
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
	1.082943436041135
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
	1.0642413060209892
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
	1.0504647790159458
personages in this land."
	1.0172659994584787

	nan
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young
	1.0712444574625213
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
	1.0553651019115167
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
	1.0418558958189665
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
	1.077273510307074
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
	1.0654578377998005
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
	1.0667789272309802
inclined to take immediate advantage of."
	1.021749819576607

	nan
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out."
	1.094603551443144

	nan
"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine
	1.0833084533179171
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
	1.0887706603702285
a friendly eye."
	1.0089595112801526

	nan
"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
	1.0968907954962892
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
	1.0412038026139048
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
	1.0793900355557238
effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
	1.0642943842099757
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
	1.0718011688855096
his life! It is admirable!"
	1.0125516659873033

	nan
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
	1.0771089838756065
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
	1.0838909872984261
little agreeable to her.
	1.0135972189026419

"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
	1.0672258008294075
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
	1.0412963462436495
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
	0.0
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
	1.0755724892596417
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
	1.0944947011540669
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
	1.086745721241425
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
	1.0708951600154828
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.
	1.0583270902761133
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
	1.072233673989396
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
	1.0554002623445298
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
	1.0569693941577387
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
	1.0817007519336064
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
	1.0538986366035452
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
	1.0367719423819257
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
	1.0732134371254574
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as
	1.076605075140413
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
	1.0839658149975884
to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian
	1.0841859214810672
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
	1.064150462587815
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
	1.0714137558226038
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I
	1.0731060533762082
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
	1.0748894413447536
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
	0.0
turn?"
	nan

	nan
"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so
	1.072451724416659
strange!"
	nan

	nan
"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
	1.0939803444496885
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
	1.051541033732587
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
	1.0435605845619365
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any
	1.0667927387784715
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
	1.0748090079460222
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
	1.0696533453893786
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
	1.0838997968086677
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"
	1.0474258180327864

	nan
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
	1.0883715170372101
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
	1.0624991838387483
repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
	1.0769061635900683
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
	1.0489760068355476
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
	1.0649294120518666
what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
	1.087081791247163
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
	1.0717293247795419
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.

CHAPTER XVI.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
	1.0714252568148475
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
	1.0891484950887744
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
	1.0765581116583582
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to
	1.0767437390285997
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
	1.0466602083444094
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
	1.0556022733908885
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
	1.104181590945401
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
	1.0515670057928852
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
	1.0687373686505468
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
	1.061005999689297
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
	1.0818450790413434
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
	1.0500279081275676
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.
	1.043174463935459

	nan
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
	1.0656253858313318
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
	1.0802526089560407
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
	1.0864364412925018
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
	1.0637974142527549
high, she immediately said,
	0.993580010706604

	nan
"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
	1.1043116900864802
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's. I
	1.1018800115045786
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
	1.0652082337442568
sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
	1.0770732288404081
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
	1.0853342809726678
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."
	1.080818134630673

	nan
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
	1.0741460373680654
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
	1.0682740034987457
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs.
	1.0527224117701575
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."
	1.041364007123283

	nan
"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
	1.0832142162358687
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
	1.0741201155216595
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
	1.091103557931247
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
	1.07673963191205
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
	1.0696037435060048
sake of discovering them."
	0.9740342235023595

	nan
"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.
	1.0691100163121037
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
	1.0908504039657463
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
	1.0833528414743863
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought
	1.0780242774170525
only of _you_."
	1.004794615271557

	nan
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
	1.0896639527288154
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
	1.0762489801858213
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
	1.0624458394559706
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
	1.0474540517938289
me on this subject for ever."
	1.0144359895319028

	nan
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
	1.0657119184252146
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
	1.0594641036286303
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
	1.0653677930214043
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
	1.0876530976854075
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The
	1.0540602986253598
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
	1.0503008226947228
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
	0.0
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
	1.0789247360822132
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
	1.064530384696664
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
	1.052073142386917
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
	1.0735966748820707
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
	1.0587145756947036
affection every moment more valuable.
	0.0

	nan
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
	1.0862243645814293
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
	1.0736416097649997
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
	1.0344681989082847
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
	1.0982819910904504
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
	1.0729369603958465
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
	1.0381439113871005
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
	1.0601339606665943
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
	1.0466493790382334
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
	1.0702364382936433
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
	1.069464136571867
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
	1.0258265703155829

	nan
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
	1.0779597938260264
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
	1.0867847962579924
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
	1.0552079858198764
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."
	1.0299759946282387

	nan
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
	1.0692898096340975
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
	1.0718905625701367
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
	1.073863609242964
your relations."
	1.002600623040811

	nan
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
	1.0775397000768867
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
	1.0417793472118069
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was
	1.0860317638728876
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."
	1.0433117549788484

	nan
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
	1.0813517915099133
evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
	1.0557762023415014
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
	1.052812169905458
in civility."
	1.0020387830015176

	nan
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
	1.0861552019914622
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
	0.0
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
	1.0860265408732883
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
	1.0626520372076538
more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you
	1.072694056732481
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
	1.0481440464798921
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."
	1.064797601095683

	nan
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
	1.0791071620448915
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
	1.0836847896843644
a way."
	1.0045015887674622

	nan
"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
	1.0795135320570721
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
	1.0744274103262663
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
	1.044483708076294
way, that would induce you to accept me."
	1.0330482509744507

	nan
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
	1.0905309943886754
all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."
	1.0926753147238633

	nan
Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
	1.084637040165918
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
	1.069921815020355
contents?"
	nan

	nan
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
	1.0826152751778801
former prejudices had been removed.
	1.019802945434052

	nan
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
	1.0893276724632284
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
	1.0714002837641525
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
	0.0
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
	1.0563301315432738
justly make you hate me."
	1.0039473574196327

	nan
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
	1.0711258158236436
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
	1.071753407650966
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
	1.0438486656402541
changed as that implies."
	1.0019703113584852

	nan
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
	1.0678169580161587
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
	1.0626661507320032
dreadful bitterness of spirit."
	1.0106800071377537

	nan
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
	1.0747590210758573
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
	1.1078934670014668
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
	1.093687535575512
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
	1.0349535327425816
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
	1.03212343678115
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
	1.087597781029047
pleasure."
	nan

	nan
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_
	1.076300237014366
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
	1.0613680559933674
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
	1.055945937748129
ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will
	1.0721600543234684
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a
	1.0658410563463283
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a
	1.085402254706017
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
	1.0279312115366257
temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
	0.0
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
	1.0796239794141798
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
	1.0701132033592222
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
	1.0327384352175877
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
	1.0532781616664
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
	1.1000627408557133
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
	1.0679435509094661
my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
	1.1080322933731028
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
	1.0595358408494757
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
	1.0735083403159054
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a
	1.088139417841624
doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my
	1.0662050891446848
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."
	1.0499408565717268

	nan
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"
	1.0339279096371319

	nan
"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
	1.1022594618388464
wishing, expecting my addresses."
	1.0072845386490312

	nan
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.
	1.084974475649775
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
	1.0865035894633615
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"
	1.0409302243923921

	nan
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
	1.0871351677122227
a proper direction."
	1.0076565102032164

	nan
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
	1.0867482013635374
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"
	1.036090788727385

	nan
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."
	1.0401083496520116

	nan
"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
	1.0777753539825665
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
	1.0676424402361744
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."
	1.0357030140518122

	nan
"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
	1.0722513903397763
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
	1.1110513419419286
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
	1.0751256229192578
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
	1.078908009929177
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
	1.0742313105111563
hour after I had seen you."
	1.0168688929469425

	nan
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
	1.088443339582432
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
	1.0205717489971797
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
	1.0708951570312952
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
	1.06274446750181
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
	1.046365459070728
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
	1.0753472131667494
comprehend.

	nan
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
	1.0710571996796623
each, to be dwelt on farther.
	1.0263401794816007

	nan
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
	1.0774207413720391
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
	1.0629088155248012
it was time to be at home.
	1.0305290453651865

	nan
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
	1.0830190081684803
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with
	1.0641525511018455
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
	1.0494547604152413
it.
	nan

	nan
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.
	1.0474003345910594

	nan
"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."
	1.1022323317508629

	nan
"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And
	1.0992586328286138
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
	1.0663071354705773
the case.
	1.0074523372036341

	nan
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession
	1.091875708404582
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of
	1.1114600035240485
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
	1.0650735527197777
absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the
	1.07572682782171
slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
	1.0495764872104112
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
	1.0565311404833826
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
	1.0822926135132884
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."
	1.057312691311201

	nan
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
	1.0668730620488172
friend.
	nan

	nan
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
	1.0730146634580904
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"
	1.0666848937995126

	nan
"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
	1.088241090796984
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."
	1.0901272582590427

	nan
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
	1.061080615552307
him."
	nan

	nan
"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
	1.0762234001903797
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
	1.067475396982035
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
	1.0847806709483954
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
	1.0771555958174277
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
	1.0529542007388906
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
	1.083666097683717
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
	1.0727642772688102
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
	1.0854074615772482
now."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
	1.0824346231462667
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
	1.0541794076267308
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
	1.0962699388741468
was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
	1.0760126175470686
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
	1.0810110219260356
conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.

CHAPTER XVII.
	1.0045069902274852

	nan

	nan
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question
	1.073666881463245
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
	1.0755600052000018
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in
	1.1057118195417581
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
	1.0507979504728084
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
	1.058690081093133
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
	1.002639391853944

	nan
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The
	1.0608018331193645
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
	1.029582611360005
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
	1.0715493545921708
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
	1.0645165265397731
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
	1.0315287165225513
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in
	1.0739694757561369
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
	1.0819411204816514
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
	1.0572262287653416
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
	1.0555129584543088

	nan
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
	1.091950400887153
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
	1.0672710526613085

	nan
"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
	1.1028374668338972
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."
	1.0664471739192922

	nan
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
	1.0800143561899513
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
	1.1027796748530712
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
	1.1161213421451963
engaged."
	nan

	nan
Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
	1.105445401912103
you dislike him."
	1.0015514669585384

	nan
"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
	1.113226564232033
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these,
	1.1107656451825705
a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
	1.0922210733952586
remember it myself."
	1.006562236534526

	nan
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
	1.0679755168306686
seriously assured her of its truth.
	1.0099873255789353

	nan
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried
	1.0873272284559568
Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
	1.09426366121355
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
	1.0422110368818736
happy with him?"
	0.9825657569783871

	nan
"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
	1.0973383062053914
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
	1.0973044413136623
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"
	1.0480356446337764

	nan
"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
	1.0715869346258615
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
	1.087185263718417
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than
	1.0715155308764366
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
	1.0668544331805605
to do?"
	nan

	nan
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
	1.1060976309978767
tell you all."
	0.9831233175096054

	nan
"What do you mean?"
	1.0108767509109908

	nan
"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
	1.102748772907231
afraid you will be angry."
	1.0063641335290237

	nan
"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious. I want to talk very seriously.
	1.0917367488953493
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell
	1.1028574324414546
me how long you have loved him?"
	1.0035002619456583

	nan
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
	1.0929743517976978
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
	1.087529666723676
at Pemberley."
	1.0002275686981978

	nan
Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
	1.0534695754379328
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
	1.0522828896665242
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
	1.0449656628218023
farther to wish.
	0.9852058518547432

	nan
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I
	1.098786234662659
always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
	0.0
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
	1.0563607576510456
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
	1.0729743269651997
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
	1.0928935525313834
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
	1.0547142882708673
of it, to another, not to you."
	1.0388080080974327

	nan
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
	1.093035704063951
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
	1.0664787574159633
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
	1.0973984342132992
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,
	1.078111200610817
and half the night spent in conversation.
	1.0470331034998142

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
	1.089460759941424
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
	1.0679972910935263
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
	1.057620446588286
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
	1.0754629591777871
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
	1.0931141765833068
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
	1.0901789269777442
way."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
	1.0579366977120193
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
	1.0716925526499463
epithet.
	nan

	nan
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
	1.063705628130796
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
	1.0590825687702703
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes
	1.0852423330429999
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"
	1.059367796737367

	nan
"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk
	1.1025357807798235
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
	1.1192297184800915
never seen the view."
	0.9611855073639548

	nan
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am
	1.1026225952641346
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty?"
	1.0597075955611501

	nan
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
	1.084623414361522
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
	1.0652482133120125
consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,
	1.0930820320623924
saying,
	nan

	nan
"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
	1.0729538244133572
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
	1.0845593061963459
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
	1.0896959527749486
him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
	1.0535487614539856
inconvenience."
	nan

	nan
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be
	1.0847620475425361
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
	1.0814719273597153
application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother
	1.0586535853142165
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
	1.053616286440489
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
	1.0888769932018865
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
	1.0604912308838896
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
	1.079183142093232
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
	1.0949091595762441
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
	1.0555502486715231
disapprobation.

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
	1.1006528209861497
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
	1.095975531373567
extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
	1.0770989757972889
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
	1.066360462458065
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
	1.0670239862284012
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
	1.0787714348858253
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
	1.0656305792731042
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
	1.098502795651434
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
	1.0687901635853083
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
	1.0899738970887438
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.
	1.0585888902237381

	nan
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
	1.0758159815034276
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
	1.081350835051679
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"
	1.0196390912163948

	nan
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
	1.070794947729742
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
	1.053789390545687
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
	1.044279186218701
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
	1.0682153199173297
her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
	1.028744810925006

	nan
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
	1.1022880964160884
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
	1.0712280081763705
But will they make you happy?"
	1.0202486197428369

	nan
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
	1.0686332912828724
indifference?"
	nan

	nan
"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
	1.113033999387927
this would be nothing if you really liked him."
	1.0466601041866184

	nan
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.
	1.111030985265378
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
	1.1029992273888638
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
	1.0802439385163152
such terms."
	1.0041829716548263

	nan
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind
	1.0906381108361078
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he
	1.0888248776089462
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
	1.0796243018596194
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your
	1.079767418370413
disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
	1.059127894843329
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
	1.0413671062216912
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
	1.079125896268859
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
	1.0438430344688872
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
	1.0720000735877173
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
	1.0866804706462456
about."
	nan

	nan
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
	1.063223989176686
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the
	1.0808205506157664
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
	1.0649505304862183
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
	1.0443128545127065
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
	1.1028355950796431
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
	1.0413147967332892
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
	1.0785350546652193

	nan
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
	1.0795859180630534
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
	0.0
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."
	1.0414158601863246

	nan
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
	1.0782291644237947
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
	1.0708905131327238

	nan
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
	1.0834762376069111
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
	1.0876339211611132
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
	1.0935557118992996
and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
	1.0918782182462141
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
	1.0520708590968493
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
	1.0933458840447348
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
	1.0663365676169134
Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
	1.0902393538016437
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
	1.0938075129113363
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."
	1.0796882899043516

	nan
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
	1.082466346256023
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
	1.0885967462136397
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
	1.0785710575195597
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
	1.0651566126784966
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
	1.0544741668045061
would come in time.
	1.0134265307113959

	nan
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
	1.092088081250342
and made the important communication. Its effect was most
	1.0607963634524964
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and
	0.0
unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that
	1.0859137333932631
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
	1.062175904048972
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
	1.0636241688837011
shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to
	1.0935747027722769
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
	1.076203834033839
herself.
	nan

	nan
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
	1.0854263402929574
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
	1.06998226844894
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
	1.0709551075392656
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
	1.090333298970719
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
	1.0764406838141583
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
	1.0622591517241091
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
	1.072959331912214
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
	1.06423808560652
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."
	1.0726833695735787

	nan
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
	1.0774552146982492
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
	1.0580378210911179
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
	1.04948516035254
her mother followed her.
	1.0143118739112202

	nan
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
	1.0680194375835135
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
	1.0910536574732677
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
	1.0859174023448064
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
	1.07125124781579
that I may have it to-morrow."
	1.0380644355722606

	nan
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
	1.0909275428952254
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain
	1.029352669042089
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
	1.0413605030280164
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
	1.0706047517951887
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
	1.0508158385139212
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
	1.0832002310658166
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
	1.0964439351764792
her deference for his opinion.
	1.0158475214842373

	nan
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
	1.07336858709012
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
	1.0706420087836417
every hour in his esteem.
	1.0189137311794345

	nan
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps,
	1.0779769295159685
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
	1.0870662460610532
as Jane's."

CHAPTER XVIII.

	nan

	nan
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
	1.073632195513594
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could
	1.0974846216154681
you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
	1.062958164822156
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
	1.076457918437293
place?"
	nan

	nan
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
	1.1170155118647294
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
	1.1117126026884843
knew that I _had_ begun."
	1.008314169218248

	nan
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
	1.0737548081583501
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
	1.0908045450327783
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
	1.0866046037851407
did you admire me for my impertinence?"
	1.022616321625118

	nan
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."
	1.052049027671785

	nan
"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
	1.0972175728385434
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
	1.0774291106218468
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
	0.0
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
	1.0729808283861044
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
	1.0695482911946996
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
	1.071409054758112
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
	1.0613103418294776
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
	1.061324618184159
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
	1.077485033741562
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
	1.0656166495350057
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
	1.0867789310251896
of _that_ when they fall in love."
	1.034518692237366

	nan
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
	1.0814827981883128
ill at Netherfield?"
	0.9918901626490852

	nan
"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
	1.094374262494405
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
	1.084858458271309
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
	1.0825038496955954
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
	1.074529507855077
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
	1.0745344641029546
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
	1.1269716117494732
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
	1.0387311086300866
you look as if you did not care about me?"
	1.034516804204178

	nan
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."
	1.0670016543442675

	nan
"But I was embarrassed."
	1.0190269649861123

	nan
"And so was I."
	1.0181416293168541

	nan
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."
	1.0710491925194343

	nan
"A man who had felt less, might."
	1.0352409805357035

	nan
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
	1.077040933724107
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
	1.093633514441981
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
	1.0873979407528058
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
	1.0630834205642297
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too
	1.0568050875247632
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
	1.0665354989997926
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
	1.0874515974553602
subject? This will never do."
	1.003666252621745

	nan
"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
	1.0826118956256712
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
	1.0697601760697788
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
	1.0690186167971951
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to
	1.0908974802758025
wait for any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me
	1.056135307548462
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."
	1.0554639741401544

	nan
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
	1.0787628270929885
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
	1.0986522225166082
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
	1.0759865222650304
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"
	1.0300695514229863

	nan
"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
	1.0919912269728411
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
	1.0622288806121187
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
	1.063425674093607
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."
	1.1095668989326024

	nan
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to
	1.0746239090268228
befall her?"
	nan

	nan
"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to
	1.0908767193906945
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
	1.0927697109052776
directly."
	nan

	nan
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
	1.1069390272334296
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
	1.0855796406303926
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."
	1.065595772624113

	nan
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
	1.0766107184023177
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
	1.0764957152135948
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
	1.0568954895251301
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
	1.0747332659432247
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
	1.0573898019488768
follows:
	nan

	nan
     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
	1.075110845271122
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
	1.0499049418492268
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than
	1.1006707442677914
     really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
	1.0749470433728274
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
	1.033985079436059
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
	1.041051708999295
     actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very
	1.0515305089495899
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I
	1.0782204922339456
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I
	1.0753644409962029
     be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.
	1.0938418058523884
     We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in
	1.1014179629120568
     the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
	1.080510398425772
     with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I
	1.0881931754548144
     laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
	1.1028635533961841
     spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
	1.0887689943040613

	nan
     Your's, &c."
	1.0120159653125875

	nan
Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and
	1.0975341063105357
still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in
	1.0819195281728518
reply to his last.
	1.0034755068875263

	nan
     "DEAR SIR,
	nan

	nan
     "I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will
	1.0603290797258624
     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as
	1.0841267736008704
     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has
	1.1060780136015498
     more to give.
	1.005496948390606

	nan
     "Your's sincerely, &c."
	1.0188455922241653

	nan
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
	1.0623631273749234
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
	0.0
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
	1.092960229715252
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
	1.0643397942139359
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
	1.0583306369819105
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
	1.0592425381855006

	nan
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
	1.0596934189772567
as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were
	1.089417146775497
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
	1.0660375515122396
being loved by her sister.
	1.0133812869335956

	nan
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
	1.0726456156143276
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
	1.0722187767649691
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden
	1.0838620171512943
removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so
	0.0
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
	1.0369762205824722
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
	1.077422922923746
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
	1.1057794887776826
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
	1.0781627414888943
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
	1.0485360177331766
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
	1.096718395729406
husband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even
	1.0758523472384431
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
	1.0638398869952748
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
	1.089862044991838
meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did
	1.09276171656725
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
	1.0890929142327745

	nan
Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
	1.0929544423405333
forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
	1.0571012717272175
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
	1.064175871296018
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
	1.0397159539282341
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
	1.0818189084624499
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
	1.0791856630866705
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
	1.0741146639740684
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
	1.079559175509017
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
	1.0336829027518544
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
	1.08625263719287
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
	0.0
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
	1.0783331363692767
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
	1.0601950530866358
Pemberley.

Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
	1.0982797534409903
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
	1.0562688532155085
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed.
	1.0834210935975574
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
	1.0883354073710734
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
	1.08215405204742
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
	1.0504742820676543
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
	1.07443216963568
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
	1.0496708103294883
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
	1.0639327268476286
invariably silly.
	0.9789406062274912

	nan
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
	1.0764003845238892
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. He delighted in
	1.0790941850096518
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
	1.0329369961455253

	nan
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
	1.0931972528289249
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
	1.0807878709847927
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
	1.072946569651871
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
	1.0587952864968413
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
	1.0809968121812064
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
	1.0485396952091046

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
	1.0889177001557202
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
	1.082304854425222
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
	1.0622676643681468
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she
	0.0
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
	1.037932919725131
ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
	1.0732978149656593
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
	1.0577665824022349
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
	1.070790061910413
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
	1.0578631748859342

	nan
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
	1.0820945083216624
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite
	1.0754195772328958
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
	1.0996904649173151
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
	1.0769887557709446
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
	1.03184314708133
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
	1.0733589269321915
much reluctance.

	nan
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
	1.0666593098229555
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
	1.081869876201427
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
	1.0569149452460718
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
	1.079961942057007
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
	1.053990980303724
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
	1.06637420462485
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
	1.0862707742533564
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
	1.091766196895076
effect:
	nan

	nan
     "MY DEAR LIZZY,
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
     "I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
	1.1237899400514446
     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you
	1.0933542708546518
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
	1.0834042463597797
     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
	1.086934371797592
     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
	1.0681629943332827
     upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four
	1.076814913632612
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,
	1.0793752511475112
     if you had rather not.
	1.0157714100554183

	nan
     "Yours, &c."
	1.0045069902274852

	nan
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
	1.0691673710928007
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.
	1.09592739298873
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
	1.0836066523383603
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
	1.062347833994648
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
	1.0666483520450205
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
	1.0479551343701592
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
	1.0684080682263573
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
	1.0425272492061615
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
	1.0535524272278354
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
	1.0543303188460698
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
	1.0552364837226076
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
	1.07674489219563
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
	1.051678750055741
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
	1.0720769463549806
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
	1.069789292406717
reputation which her marriage had given her.
	1.0250599739042032

	nan
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
	1.0549903463219406
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was
	1.0755345987388465
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
	1.0598150425584196
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
	1.0849037747119386
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
	1.0758175797676037
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.
	1.07704521373431

	nan
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
	1.086168955308364
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
	1.051277389403566
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
	1.0498581166562295
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
	1.0604658242085367
to Elizabeth.
	1.0054348241103839

	nan
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
	1.0793374332602443
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
	1.0902332597990811
other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
	1.0686258332151921
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
	1.0805060921321967
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
	1.0151690359572458
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
	1.0658467024716287
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
	1.0695209068303633
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
	1.0569492920225
her way. By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
	1.0793071519818465
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
	1.0487414719109422
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

	nan
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
	1.0683433455653926
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
	1.0911781072287998
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
	1.0670468244235736
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
	1.0528333748792407
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
	1.082876637572073
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
	1.071119099347452
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
	1.0843097412970042
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
	1.0623290625014052
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
	1.0761763937159834
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
	1.0567404600815677
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
	1.0452846370752613
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
	1.047101047785833

	nan
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,
	1.0857561230078474
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
	1.0605937585169671
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
	1.0642407667724467
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
